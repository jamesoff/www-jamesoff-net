Here it finally is! In all it's Technicolour glory is the <B>#ags Review '97</B> - a sample of all the funny, stupid, and lame things we have done over the past year (well, the part of it that we were online).<BR>
<BR>
Compiled and Annotated by James "JamesOff" Seward and Stephen "Dudley" Sharp<BR>
Extracts taken from #startrek and #amigauae (and even one from #lesbian - see <A HREF="#lesbian">below</A>) - thanks to everyone from those channels (well, maybe not the latter) for providing us with a source of amusement.<BR><BR>
It's easy to read. It's just like being on IRC. This was compiled using James' logs. All times are in London time. No animals were harmed in the making of this review. Printed on recycled electrons.
<HR>
#AGS was formed on the 7th June 1997. It took Kit approximatly one minute to get kicked after James first joined...
<BR><BR>
<I>[23:05] &lt;Sniper_&gt; He he he he he POWER!<BR>
[23:05] * dudley_ slaps Sniper_ around a bit with a large trout<BR>
[23:05] *** Sniper_ was kicked by JamesOff (Not power)</I>
<P>
Of course, it didn't take long before people made their opinions clear...
<P>
<I>&lt;JamesOff&gt;  Kit: David says your nick is gay</I>
<P>
And within the night, violence broke out...
<P>
<I>[23:17] &lt;sniper_&gt; bang!<BR>
[23:17] * dudley_ shoots kit with bigger gun<BR>
[23:17] * dudley_ shoots kit with biggest gun<BR>

[23:17] * dudley_ shoots kit with soot's gun(s)<BR>
[23:17] &lt;sniper_&gt; kit launches balistic missile<BR>
[23:17] * dudley_ slaps firelance around with exocet<BR>
[23:18] * firelance launches an atomic bomb and a hydrogen bomb to<BR>
shut everyone up!<BR>
[23:18] * dudley_ pokes kit with gibbon<BR>
[23:18] * firelance slaps dudley_ around a bit with a large trout<BR>
[23:18] * firelance slaps jamesoff around a bit with a large trout<BR>
[23:18] * firelance slaps sniper_ around a bit with a large trout<BR>
[23:18] * sniper_ cruely injures firelance with extinguisher</I>
<P>
#AGS likes to think of itself as a fair channel, and a few rules and regualtions were soon introduced to help keep the peace
<P>
<I>[23:09] &lt;Dudley_&gt; people will be kicked for the following: Over-use of colours and Bold, threats, and just being a twat<BR>
[23:09] &lt;Kit&gt; FUN FUN FUN FUN<BR>
[23:09] &lt;Kit&gt; he he he he he<BR>
[23:09] &lt;Kit&gt; FUN -<BR>
[23:09] * Kit in purple<BR>
[23:09] *** Kit was kicked by Dudley_ (that's being a twat)</I>
<P>
And we all remember the first bot #AGS had, Enterspac. How cute...
<P>
<I>[23:36] &lt;JamesOff&gt; bot status<BR>
* Enterspac is superbon
</I><P>
However, things once again got vicious
<P>
<I>&lt;JamesOff&gt; bot replicate a toenail clipping<BR>
[23:50] * Enterspac replicates a a toenail clipping for JamesOff<BR>
* JamesOff cuts Skunko to ribbons using a toenail clipping<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; :)<BR>
* JamesOff LOLs<BR>
[23:51] &lt;Skunko&gt; hehe<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; sorry about that<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; bot replicate a bandage<BR>
[23:52] * Enterspac replicates a a bandage for JamesOff<BR>
* JamesOff hands Skunko the bandage<BR>
[23:52] &lt;Dudley_&gt; &lt;g&gt;<BR>
[23:53] &lt;Skunko&gt; thanks<BR>
[23:55] * Dudley_ cruelly rips bandage off and pour viniger into<BR>
wound<BR>
[23:56] &lt;Skunko&gt; ow!
</I><P>
Those were the days... :) ... cute the bot may have been, but it still had a few bugs:
<P>
<I>[22:58] &lt;Dudley_&gt; bot op Dudley_<BR>
[22:58] &lt;JMSBot&gt; Dudley_: Have a little talk with JamesOff or Dudley_<BR>
[22:58] &lt;Dudley_&gt; I AM DUDLEY_!!!!!!!!!
</I><P>
And the ops in #AGS have always been &quot;Special&quot;
<P>
<I>&lt;JamesOff&gt; brb - answering a call of nature (i.e. tea)</I>
<P>
And despite their cynical attitude...
<P>
<I>[23:23] &lt;Dudley_&gt;  James - It appears you've pulled. &lt;g&gt;</I>
<P>
(Just so you know, I was raped in #startrek :( - JMS)
<P>
Their caring side always wins through
<P>
<I>[23:31] &lt;Dudley_&gt; * Dudley_ hands Jamesoff an in-depth &quot;How to cope with a traumatic experience&quot; leaflet.</I>
<P>
We've even had competitions from time to time
<P>
<I>[0:58] *** Dudley_ changes topic to &quot;Guess James' surname. win a cabbage&quot;<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; seward?<BR>
[0:59] &lt;Dudley_&gt; WE HAVE A WINNER!!!!
</I><P>
#AGS moves with the times
<P>
<I>[0:47] &lt;SoulEdge&gt; &#163;= how many shillings?<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; shilling? :P<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; this is 1997<BR>
[0:48] &lt;SoulEdge&gt; okay. I'm not familiar with English currency you know :)<BR>
[0:48] &lt;Dudley_&gt; shillings disapeared in 1969<BR>
[0:48] &lt;SoulEdge&gt; oh well</I>
<P>
(That's lag for you)
<P>
Dudley very quickly proved how stupid he really is
<P>
<I>[0:58] * Dudley_ warns  dudley that any futher warning will result in a kick<BR>
[0:58] * Dudley_ warns  dudley for the last time that any futher warning will result in a kick<BR>
[0:58] *** Dudley_ was kicked by Dudley_ (no warnings)<BR>
[0:58] *** Joins: Dudley_<BR>
[0:59] * Dudley_ frowns at Dudley</I>
<P>
June 15 was a great day for #ags becuase this happened:
<P>
<I>[1:14] *** Joins: AnyOne</I>
<P>
Kit leaps straight in there with his defence of the channel
<P>
<I>[1:15] &lt;Kit_&gt; kick him<BR>
[1:15] &lt;AnyOne&gt; kick who?<BR>
[1:15] &lt;Kit_&gt; oh - so he's not a pest<BR>
[1:15] &lt;AnyOne&gt; Not me I hope<BR>
[1:15] &lt;AnyOne&gt; he? I'm a she!!<BR>
[1:15] &lt;Dudley_&gt; anyone = kim = not male.<BR>
[1:15] &lt;Kit_&gt; Ahhhh - tricky to tell on mIRC</I>
<P>
Well done Kit (who has now got Kim coming to visit in Summer '98).
<P>
We're now going to take a short break to bring you this bit of humour from #startrek
<P>
<I>[0:03] &lt;Intendent&gt; If the earth were truly flat would games using a ball have been invented?<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; int: no... we'd use a cheese slice<BR>
[0:03] &lt;Intendent&gt; James!<BR>
[0:04] &lt;Intendent&gt; Good show!!!!<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; :)<BR>
[0:04] &lt;Intendent&gt; hehehhe<BR>
[0:04] * Intendent gives james a +v just for answering that corrrectly.<BR>
[0:04] *** Intendent sets mode: +v JamesOff<BR>
[0:04] &lt;Intendent&gt; heheheheh<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; wow! bonus question :P<BR>
[0:05] &lt;Intendent&gt; hahahahahahahahha<BR>
[0:05] &lt;Dudley_&gt; Conversly you'd use a haggis instead of a frisbee<BR>
[0:05] &lt;Dudley_&gt; and boomerangs would have 56 corners<BR>
[0:05] &lt;Intendent&gt; Dud!<BR>
[0:05] *** Intendent sets mode: +v Dudley_</I>
<P>
We now return to normal scheduling...
<P>
<I>[1:37] * Dudley_ has legs</I>
<P>
Well that's normal for #ags :)
<P>
Meanwhile, dudley's employment of a warning alias to give people a chance to mend their ways was not universally approved...
<P>
<I>[1:38] * Kit_ WARNS dudley that any mentioning of combine harversters will result in a pumpkin being inserted in #@#]{{<BR>
[1:39] * Dudley_ warns  Kit_ that any futher pinching of his aliases will result in a kick</I>
<P>
--
<P>
And #AGS' logic is always perfect...
<P>
<I>[1:59] &lt;Kit_&gt; missile = several stage estes model rocket with 1/4 pound touch explosive - will gut bottom of house quite easily<BR>
[1:59] * Dudley_ toss<BR>
[1:59] &lt;Dudley_&gt; BOOOOOOOOOOM!<BR>
[1:59] &lt;Dudley_&gt; If bottom of house is gutted top usually follows</I>

Concern for our fellow users is always a priority
<P>
<I>[2:12] &lt;AnyOne&gt; uh u guys I think I swallowed something and its clogging my airway a bit<BR>
[2:13] * Dudley_ does remote heimlich (tm) on kim<BR>
[2:13] &lt;Kit_&gt; Tip head forward and cough - NOW!<BR>
[2:13] &lt;Kit_&gt; Heinrich - German<BR>
[2:13] &lt;Kit_&gt; GET BUSY COUGHING<BR>
[2:13] &lt;Kit_&gt; Kit feels justified in using caps here<BR>
[2:13] &lt;AnyOne&gt; I'm not dying u guys its just annoying! But thanks for the thought</I>
<P>

Dudley's route length doubling shortcuts are legendary...
<P>
<I>* JamesOff trusts Dudley not to do a &quot;Gt Missenden -&gt; Prestwood shortcut&quot; again<BR>
[23:55] &lt;dudley_&gt; &lt;g&gt;<BR>
[23:55] &lt;dudley_&gt; It's a train. There are suprisingly few shortcuts with rail tracks<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; not if you're in charge :P</I>
<P>

<P>
In order to stop Kit mentioning encryption, especially using the program PGP, Dudley got a kick-on-word script...
<P>
<I>[23:41] &lt;dudley_&gt; and again. ONCE. like &quot;PGP&quot;<BR>
[23:41] &lt;Kit_&gt; PGP<BR>
[23:41] *** Kit_ was kicked by dudley_ (Shut up about PGP)<BR>
[23:41] &lt;dudley_&gt; YES!<BR>

&lt;JamesOff&gt;  Kit: don't mention the well known encryption program which begins with P<BR>
[23:42] &lt;Kit_&gt; PG*<BR>
[23:42] &lt;Kit_&gt; PG&Egrave;<BR>
[23:42] &lt;Kit_&gt; hmmm - there is a sort of P somewhere in there<BR>

<A NAME="lesbian">When a user was abusive, Dudley chased him across channels, however he did on occasion get distracted...
<P>

<P>
And a lagged misunderstanding of Kit(UK) being nice to Kim(Canada) resulted in this topic...
<P>
<I>*** dudley_ changes topic to &quot;Shock as Kit claims to have 6000 mile long %&amp;$%&amp;!&quot;</I>

<P>
Ahhh bless... it's the first ever &quot;topic&quot; we had when Kim didn't realise what she'd said in English slang
<P>
<I>[1:01] &lt;FairyDust&gt; Hey James Wanna take me?<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; * There is an uncomfortable pause</I>
<P>
Fortunately, once Kim was aware of her error, everything was cleared up
<P>

One thing you could never accuse us of is stupidity

Because we're computer scientists, we know our way around the insides of the magic boxes
<P>
<I>[0:00] &lt;dudley_&gt; Main things in ANY Pc.<BR>
[0:00] &lt;dudley_&gt; CPu - Processor - does the work. Mostly made by Intel. Looks like a black Square.<BR>
[0:01] &lt;Kitsune_X&gt; *nod*<BR>
[0:01] &lt;dudley_&gt; Memory - Looks like a little black rectangle. Super-fast but needs constant power.<BR>
[0:01] &lt;dudley_&gt; stores stuff<BR>
[0:01] &lt;Kitsune_X&gt; how?<BR>
&lt;JamesOff&gt; power supply - shiny square thing. don't open it<BR>
[0:01] &lt;dudley_&gt; computers store using 0 and 1s<BR>
[0:02] * dudley_ tries to work out how to explain.<BR>
[0:03] &lt;dudley_&gt; James? can you explain binary numbers easily?<BR>
[0:03] * Kitsune_X know binary.<BR>
[0:03] &lt;dudley_&gt; good<BR>
[0:03] &lt;dudley_&gt; That's how things are stored.<BR>
[0:12] &lt;dudley_&gt; Hard disk - stores same as memory but much slower. Does however not need any power.<BR>
[0:13] &lt;reaperman&gt; cpu = very useful :P<BR>
[0:13] &lt;reaperman&gt; :)<BR>
[0:13] &lt;dudley_&gt; Hard disk is the loud buzzy thing that takes up most of the startup time</I>
