    <p>spithash: I haven't tried it with IPv6 so I'm not sure. Wouldn't be difficult to fix though I expect.<&#47;p>

    <p>I'm afraid I don't accept link requests for my bots :)<&#47;p>

<p>[TopicEngine](topicengine)<br />

<p>TopicEngine is a script for managing the topic on IRC channels. It has multi-channel support, will stop the topic being truncated if you try to use one that's too long, will reset the topic after a netsplit, and has fine-tuneable permissions (using eggdrop flags). It also supports things like pre- and postfixes on topics, topic locking, regular expressions (find and replace in the topic), and undo.</p>
<p>[QuoteEngine](quoteengine)<br />
---</p>
<p>The QuoteEngine is a IRC quote database script for eggdrop which interfaces with mySQL to store the quotes. It supports multiple channels and easy-to-manage permissions. It also has a web interface for browsing the quotes.</p>
<p>[ProxyCheck](proxycheck)<br />

<p>proxycheck performs RBL lookups on people joining your channel and bans people who are listed. Per-channel toggle, configurable ban duration, configurable RBL usage.</p>
<p>[noiphost](noiphost)<br />
---<br />

<p>[guardchan](guardchan)<br />
