<p>I'm sure this page was a better idea when I was sorting out my site layout. Never mind.</p>
<p>The only thing I have to put here at the moment is my <code>&#47;stats p<&#47;code> mod for hybrid.</p>
<p>It changes the output from &#47;stats p to include the oper's &#47;away status. Opers who are &#47;away will get `(Away)` appended to their stats P line.</p>
<p>Download: [stats\_p\_away.diff](&#47;download&#47;stats_p_away.diff).  This patch is against hybrid7.0-rc9, but will probably work on similar versions.</p>
