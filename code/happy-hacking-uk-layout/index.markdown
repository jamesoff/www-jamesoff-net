This is a Windows UK keyboard layout for a [Happy Hacking](http://www.pfusystems.com/embedded-keyboard/hhkb/index.html) keyboard.

* Shift-3 gives # (because that's where I'm used to having it now)
* Shift-2 gives "
* Shift-' gives @
* &pound; is AltGr-3 (AltGr is right Alt)

To use, download [hhuk.zip](/download/hhuk.zip), unzip and run setup.exe. Then pick "United Kingdom - Happy Hacking" from the list of keyboard layouts.
