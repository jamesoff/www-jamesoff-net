<p>After appropriating a Happy Hacking keyboard at work (an expesnive oscilloscope came with one, and the guys in the lab don't like it), I needed to fix my keyboard layout.</p>
<p>US layout gives the right results for the backslash and backtick keys, but screws up poundsign, double-quote and at-sign.</p>
<p>UK layout fixes the last three, but stuffs up the keys in the top right.</p>
<p>Here's a keyboard layout you can use to fix all that!</p>
<p> * Shift-3 gives # (because that's where I'm used to having it now)<br />
 * Shift-2 gives "<br />
 * Shift-' gives @<br />
 * Poundsign is AltGr-3 (AltGr is right Alt).</p>
<p>To use, download [hhuk.zip](&#47;download&#47;hhuk.zip), unzip and run setup.exe. Then pick "United Kingdom - Happy Hacking" from the list of keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>(Update 20121109: Tested and works with Windows 8. Fixes keyboard layout in a VM inside VMware Fusion.)</p>
