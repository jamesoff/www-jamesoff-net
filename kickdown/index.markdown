Want calming music when you're stuck in a traffic jam and something a bit more fun when you're zooming along?</p>
<p>All you need to do is set up some playlists in iTunes or on your device, and then tell Kickdown which playlist to use at which speed.</p>
<p>Kickdown supports any method for connecting to your car stereo including dock accessories, FM transmitters and Bluetooth streaming.</p>
<p><strong>Get it<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Kickdown is available on the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;itunes.apple.com&#47;gb&#47;app&#47;kickdown&#47;id534978859?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store<&#47;a>.<br &#47;></p>
<p><strong>Setting up<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Setting up Kickdown is straightforward.</p>
<p>First, make sure you've got some playlists on your device, and that they have some tracks in. iTunes Match is supported, but the tracks must be downloaded to the device already. (You can scroll to the end of the playlist in the Music app and tap the cloud&#47;download icon to download everything in a playlist.)<br />

<p>Next, open Kickdown and go to the Playlists tab. (The first time you start Kickdown you'll be asked which units you prefer to measure speed in. Kickdown tries to guess but needs you to verify. If you change the units later on, Kickdown will clear your playlist&#47;speed configuration, so best set it correctly now.)<br />

<p>Tap the <strong>+<&#47;strong> button to add an entry.</p>
<p>Tap the speed item to select the speed to use for the playlist. Tap a playlist to use it when you're going faster than the chosen speed.<br />

<p>Repeat for as many playlists as you want to set up.<br />

<p>Return to the Now Playing tab and tap the play button to start.<br />

<p><strong>Tips<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
The speed displayed in the app is your average speed over the last 30 seconds. The playlist shown is the one the next track will come from.</p>
<p>If you want to immediately change to a more suitable track (for example, Kickdown is playing a track from your slow playlist because you were waiting at a junction, but you're now cruising along and want something more appropriate) then just hit the next track button.</p>
<p>Play&#47;pause and the next track control will work from the lock screen, the task switching tray, and connected accessories.</p>
<p>If another output device is available (e.g. via Bluetooth) then the AirPlay icon will show next to the volume slider. Tap it to change outputs.</p>
<p>Kickdown shuffles the contents of playlists. If you want to play them in order, find Kickdown in the Settings app and you can change it there.</p>
