    <p>French tickler flambe<&#47;p>

    <p>Take 1kg French chocolate truffles dusted with cocoa.  Eat them, taking two or three days.<&#47;p>

    <p>Then take 1 kilo brandy, not necessarily French.  Pour it down the loo.<&#47;p>

    <p>Take two bottles wine, one white and one red.  Lean out the window into the street and announce to the world that you have these bottles.<&#47;p>

    <p>Sit back, get out your collection of French ticklers, and use them with your new companions.<&#47;p>

    <p>Hi James,
    Just thought I'd write to you and let you know how brilliant I think your random food generator app is! I don't own it, but have read some of the results. Recently I've just started making apps in a similar random silly vein for Android (TravelMad, Merlin!). As usual I was bored at work and started thinking about apps to make and I was just penning my own silly food generator when I Googled it and found this. So I just wanted to say good job.<&#47;p>

<p>At the moment, these are living on the old site until I import them into the new one. Excuse the work-in-progress :)</p>
<p>## Random Recipe Generator<br />
&raquo; [http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;site&#47;fun&#47;random-recipe-generator](http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;site&#47;fun&#47;random-recipe-generator)</p>
<p>This was an interesting one to write, because it tries to keep the recipes vaguely doable by tracking which ingredients have been prepared, which have been used, and which have been discarded. The result is some very complex-looking object code and looping.</p>
<p>Currently alz and I are working on a new version which has better understanding of how to use ingredients.</p>
<p>## Random Sport Generator<br />
&raquo; [http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;site&#47;fun&#47;sport](http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;fun&#47;sport)</p>
<p>Everyone's doing Extreme Sports these days. The people I work with, for example, do Extreme Kite Flying ("Dude! It's pulling on my arms!"), Extreme Saying They Go For Walks On The Moors, and Extreme Writing Programs In Clarion. I play Extreme Badminton weekly. Of course, we mustn't forget the people who do Extreme Ironing and Hoovering and the like. If you'd like to take up your own Extreme Sport, why not get the Generator to come up with something original?</p>
