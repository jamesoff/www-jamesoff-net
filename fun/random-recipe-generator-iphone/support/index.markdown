<p><strong>How do I make recipes?<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
It's not recommended that you attempt to make any recipe the recipe generator suggests. They're for entertainment purposes only.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<strong>No really, I want to see another one!<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Tap the reload icon, top left.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<strong>Awesome! Grapes Pie! I want to share this with a chum!<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Tap the action button, top right. You can email the recipe to your bff, or copy it into the clipboard so you can paste it into facebook or something.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<strong>What are the different ingredient types for?<&#47;strong><br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>Item ingredients are things you would count in units for a recipe, like bananas.<&#47;li>
<li>Weight ingredients are things you would count in kilograms or ounces, like flour.<&#47;li>
<li>Volume ingredients are things you count in mililitres or pints, like milk.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>By using the right type when adding&#47;editing an ingredient, the recipe generator will use the right sort of units when telling you how much you need, as well as instructions suited to that sort of thing. <br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
<p><strong>I can't add my ingredient!<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Make sure your ingredient name doesn't duplicate any that already exist (of any type), and doesn't have funny characters in it.<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
<p><strong>It's not silly enough :(<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Pop over to your iPhone's Settings app and then Recipes. Turn on Insane Mode.<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
<p><strong>Insane mode isn't silly enough<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
If you're using the free version, buy the full version. It has more insane things! If that's not insane enough, try doing the recipes backwards.<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
<p><strong>I broke my ingredients list. Can I have the default one back?<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Head over to the Settings app and then Recipes. Toggle on the Reset to default setting and the next time you start Recipes, it'll reset the ingredients list to the one that ships with the app.<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
<p><strong>I don't have an Ingredients tab<&#47;strong><br &#47;><br />
Stop using the free version and man up enough to pay me for the full one.<br &#47;><br &#47;></p>
