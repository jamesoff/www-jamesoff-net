<p>While investigating some replacement candles for Roz's nice candle holders, we needed to fill in the Contact Us form on Party Lite's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.partylite.co.uk">website<&#47;a>, only to be told "This function is only supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers."</p>
<p>You'd think of all things that a Contact Us page would be cross-browser compatible, or at least they'd offer a reduced-functionality version for non-IE browsers. Since I can't run IE on my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.freebsd.org">choice of desktop OS<&#47;a>, I had to fire up my work laptop and use IE on there to fill in their form. I also took the time to locate an email address for them and email them asking why their site needed IE for that page (the rest of it works fine in Firefox).</p>
<p>I was thrilled to receive this automated reply, shown here with broken linebreaks intact as it appeared in my Inbox:</p>
