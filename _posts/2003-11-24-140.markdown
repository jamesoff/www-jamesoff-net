  content: In the next release of WordPress, the comments and posts will be managed
    on separate screens, so that won't be a problem any more.

<p>Goddamn bastard Wordpress... when you go to delete comments it lists the post at the top so I accidentally deleted that instead (again). ($*&pound;&&pound;$ Remind me to hack that.</p>
<p>Also: I have written Obscure.class.php now which does anti-spam on postings on my blog; I shall scribble a README for it and release it later today :)</p>
