<p>TriviaCow, my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jamesoff.net&#47;trivia&#47;">trivia bot<&#47;a> is getting some upgrades. It's now possible for users in the channel to report problems with questions back to us (with <code>!trivia report<&#47;code>). <code>!trivia<&#47;code> by itself will tell the user how to start the game, since many random people seem to join, try the command, and then leave when nothing happens.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, I've written an import tool for Roz, who is currently locating and adding questions. I've also made it so that we can update the category of a question in real time, to improve data quality :)</p>
<p>Now the major thing to fix is the scoring, which is a little off still.</p>
