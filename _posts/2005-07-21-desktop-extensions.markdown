<p>I've just finished setting up our test Desktop Extension system, which uses Cat5 cabling to send the KVM(Keyboard, Video, Mouse) signals to the end hardware. The computer stays in the server room, locked safely away.</p>
<p>We're trying it out for our training centre, and it's been easy enough to set up - most of my time was spent sorting out and wiring the cables that the electricians just dumped on us after they'd run them though to the server room. The quality of the display is pretty good, although there's a bit of shadowing and if you're used to spotting display artifacts you'll spot it right away. I suspect most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference though. Tonight is the litmus test, I guess.</p>
