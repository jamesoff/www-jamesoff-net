    Hello, i read your web site several months ago &amp; found it useful as i'm also getting married in sept this year. I have since then been trying to find any other reviews for bad photographers in &amp; around bristol but sadly cant find any, you seem to be the only one ready to stand up to rude people &amp; disgrace bad photographers !. If you know of any more sights of wedding photographers then let me know, maybe you could set up a "photographers review sight", as i think we could do with one.
    Any way i have booked my photographer now &amp; he's a gem so i'm happy !

    many thanks for the review
    kind regards
    Karen Gall

    I used English Rose photography and found them to be lovely. They were really helpful with ideas and our photography turned out brillliantly.
    I was organising the wedding in the south west from London and they even travelled up to me to discuss the day.

    It takes many good people to build up someones reputation, but just one to topple it. Hopefully I can readdress the balance for English Rose.

  content: I have used english rose and found them very polite and accomodating, everyone
    commented on our photos and our albumn is fab! They are the best photos i have
    seen and unlike other photographers you get all the pictures taken plus an album,
    i would pay so much more money to get decent pictures like this. I would recommend
    these to everyone getting married who wants informal pictures.

<p>English Rose Photography are rude. While Roz and her mum were trying to find photographers for our wedding, they independently phoned English Rose. However, both times they were rude about how "late" we were leaving it to book a photographer and that anyone competent would have been booked up for ages. It almost sounded like they were trying to tell us we should reschedule our wedding for 2006 or something. A friend of ours has also reported that having used them they weren't very nice anyway.</p>
