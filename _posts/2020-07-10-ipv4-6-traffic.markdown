title: Counting IPv4 vs IPv6 packets on a Unifi Security Gateway
summary: Handy to see what balance of traffic you have, and should also apply to other Linux routers.
---

Recently (after looking at the query type stats on my [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/) I wondered how much IPv4 vs IPv6 traffic my home network was driving.

I use a [UniFi Security Gateway](https://www.ui.com/unifi-routing/usg/) as my router, and presumably because it's early days for IPv6 support in UniFi, the management UI doesn't give any breakdown on traffic types by family.

You can get this info out of `netstat` though, so after sshing to the USG, the following commands will give you the traffic in packets handled by IPv4 and IPv6 (no need to be root):

```bash
echo -n "ipv4: "; netstat -s | awk '/total packets/ { print $1 }'
echo -n "ipv6: "; netstat -s6 | awk '/total packets/ { print $1 }'
```

In my case,

```text
ipv4: 158065944
ipv6: 849169602
```

So that's 15% IPv4 and 85% IPv6, which is pretty good, and interesting that my DNS queries are about 40% `A` and 40% `AAAA`, so IPv6 traffic must be driving quite a bit more traffic per request.

(Thanks to <https://ipv6-or-no-ipv6.blogspot.com/2013/06/use-netstat-to-show-ipv4-versus-ipv6.html> although I rewrote the command because every time you see `grep SOMETHING | awk` you should remember that `awk` does pattern matching so you can save yourself a pipeline step.)
