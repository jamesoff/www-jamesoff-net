title: Counting IPv4 vs IPv6 packets
summary: Handy to see what balance of traffic you have
---

Recently (after looking at the query type stats on my PiHole) I wondered how much IPv4 vs IPv6 traffic my home network was driving.

I use a UniFi Security Gateway as my router, and presumably because IPv6 support is in beta for UniFi, the management UI doesn't give any breakdown on traffic types by family.

You can get this info out of `netstat` though, so after sshing to the USG, the following commands will give you the traffic in packets handled by IPv4 and IPv6 (no need to be root):

```bash
echo -n "ipv4: "; netstat -s | awk '/total packets/ { print $1 }'
echo -n "ipv6: "; netstat -s6 | awk '/total packets/ { print $1 }'
```

In my case,

```text
ipv4: 158065944
ipv6: 849169602
```

So that's 15% IPv4 and 85% IPv6, which is pretty good, and interesting that my DNS queries are about 40% `A` and 40% `AAAA`, so IPv6 traffic must be driving quite a bit more traffic per request.

(Thanks to <https://ipv6-or-no-ipv6.blogspot.com/2013/06/use-netstat-to-show-ipv4-versus-ipv6.html> although I rewrote the command because every time you see `grep SOMETHING | awk` you should remember that `awk` does pattern matching so you can save yourself a pipeline step.)
