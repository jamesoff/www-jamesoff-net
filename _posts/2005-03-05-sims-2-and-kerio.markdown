    Thanks - I just worked that one out.  If I had read this last night I would have saved a couple of hours work.  It should be possible to work out which *.exe file is the cause but the file shown in the HIPS log is not an exe. (~e5.0001) and then add it as an exception under the advanced tab. Any ideas??

    Also you might be interested to know that all was OK till I added the latest Sims 2 upgrade patch - then the game refused to load.  (I.E. the unpatched version worked)

<p>If anyone's trying the latest beta of Kerio Personal Firewall, be advised the current beta seems to break Sims 2 if you have the Host Intrusion Prevention thing turned on. Turned it off fixed The Sims :)</p>
