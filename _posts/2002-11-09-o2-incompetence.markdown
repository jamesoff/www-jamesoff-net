  content: at least they were nice enough about it to make the changes retro-active.
    The mobile company that i was dealing with decided to take their sweet time about
    it, accuse me of being a petty criminal, bribed me, and then waited 4 months to
    actually stop sending me bills. *sigh*

<p>Finally got O2 (the mobile phone company) to cancel my account. See the Incompetence <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;forums">forums<&#47;a> for more information; the summary is that I've been trying to cancel my O2 account since April o_O<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Today I got (forwarded from my parents) a letter from them giving me 7 days to pay the balance owing on my account (&pound;55) else they'd send the nice debt collection people around or something. Needless to say, this piqued my anger so I phoned them immediately(*$* After explaining the situation twice to various people, I get through to some one who was quite shocked when I demanded that I had my account cancelled immediately while I was on the phone (mmm pregnant pause).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
It turns out that they sent me a Pay-As-You-Go SIM, but it never arrived. Activating this log is what would have cancelled my old account. *sigh*<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Meanwhile, they're cancelling it from May and so I'll get quite a bit refunded :D Excellent.</p>
