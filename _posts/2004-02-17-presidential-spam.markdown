<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.msnbc.msn.com&#47;id&#47;4276324&#47;">According to MSNBC<&#47;a>, American political candidates are going to start sending out emails promoting themselves and pointing at campaign videos on the web. What an excellent idea, now they can reach this enormous audience for next to no cost (especially compared to a paper mailshot). What isn't such a good idea about this is that you can guarantee they're going to send mail to people like me who aren't in the US (and even if I was, I wouldn't be interested in receiving email about this). Personally I shall treat any presidential email just like any other UBE and forward it off to RBLs.</p>
