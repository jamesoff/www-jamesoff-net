<p>If you cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If the markets are a drama, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If the terrorists are Saudi,<br &#47;><br />
And your alibi is shoddy,<br &#47;><br />
And your tastes remain quite gaudy,<br &#47;><br />
Bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If you never were elected, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If your mood is quite dejected, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If you think that SUVs,<br &#47;><br />
Are the best thing since sliced cheese,<br &#47;><br />
And your father you must please,<br &#47;><br />
Bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If the globe is quickly warming, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If the poor will soon be storming, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
We assert that might makes right,<br &#47;><br />
Burning oil is a delight,<br &#47;><br />
For the empire we will fight,<br &#47;><br />
Bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If we have no allies with us, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If we think that someone's dissed us, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
So to hell with the inspections,<br &#47;><br />
Let's look tough for the elections,<br &#47;><br />
Close your mind and take directions,<br &#47;><br />
Bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If corporate fraud is growin', bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If your ties to it are showin', bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
If your politics are sleazy,<br &#47;><br />
And hiding that ain't easy,<br &#47;><br />
And your manhood's getting queasy,<br &#47;><br />
Bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Fall in line and follow orders, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
For our might now knows no borders, bomb Iraq.<br &#47;><br />
Disagree? We'll call it treason,<br &#47;><br />
It's the make war not love season,<br &#47;><br />
Even if we have no reason,<br &#47;><br />
Bomb Iraq.</p>
