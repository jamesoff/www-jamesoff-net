  content: I was just reading about how an online betting company "protects" themself
    against DDoS after an extortion attempt, by paying $50,000 a year to a security
    company who have to have more bandwidth than the combination of attackers and
    does lovely filtering for you so you don't see the traffic.  This seems a bit
    of a sledgehammer to crack a nut approach, but what else can be done about it
    (DDoS attacks) at the moment?  :(
