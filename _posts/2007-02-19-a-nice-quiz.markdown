  <strong>Scenario<&#47;strong>

  You are driving your friends to a restaurant. You have a small 3-door car. You're running late or something. One of the guys in the back volunteers to jump out and run into the restaurant to tell them everyone else will be along in a minute.

  Do you:

  a) Just stop in the middle of the road while the front passenger extracts themselves from the car followed by the rear passenger (who runs to the restaurant), then wait while the front passenger waves ineffectually at the growing queue of traffic behind you instead of e.g. more promptly jumping back in the car allowing you to pull off

  or,

  b) do what everyone with an IQ does and pull up out of the way?

  Read on to find out how you did!

<p>A: You are the stupid twat who stopped in front of me in South Street to let someone get to the Real India* restaurant</p>
<p>B: You are a normal person.</p>
<p>(* An excellent choice of restaurant at least, but not enough to redeem you.)</p>
