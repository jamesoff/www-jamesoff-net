<p>I patched the module in ircd-hybrid that handles the &#47;stats command today so that &#47;stats p (which shows active opers) also shows if they're set away or not. It was as much an exercise in coding as anything else -- my C skills aren't amazing (I can read the code better than I can write it), and it also gave me something interesting to find out about the ircd code if I'm going to continue any form of h4x0ring.<br &#47;><br />
The patch is on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;irc&#47;index.php">my irc stuff page<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Also today the trivia&#47;games bot in #newbies vanished, so I fired up my old Afronym script (which I originally wrote for #efnetgirl). I never quite finished writing this script; I wrote it all in an evening, but never quite finished debugging it. We played a few rounds tonight and it worked ok -- we found one of the outstanding bugs immediately and I fixed it, but I'm sure there's something else too :) I'll probably release the script to the public very soon, which will be nice.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Then I can concentrate on the QuoteEngine since it STILL only has one command since I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.grooblehonk.co.uk&#47;index.php?p=83&more=1&c=1">wrote it in an evening<&#47;a>. #exeter's added 280-odd quotes with it tho.</p>
