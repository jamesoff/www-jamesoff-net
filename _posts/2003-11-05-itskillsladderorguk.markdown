<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.itskillsladder.org.uk">The IT Skills Ladder Website<&#47;a> launched officially this morning, and was presented in a demo to people from various companies in Exeter including South West Water.

<p>Meanwhile, bounces from spam are continuing to rumble in at a fair rate to jamesoff.net, and qmail's done 70500 deliveries since Friday evening now.</p>
