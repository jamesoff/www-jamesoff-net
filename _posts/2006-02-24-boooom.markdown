<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;b.oooom.net">http:&#47;&#47;b.oooom.net<&#47;a> is now live! This is the rewrite and proper deployment of my old quickjump thing I had on jamesoff.net.</p>
<p>Yes, it's just another URL shortener :P</p>
<p>b.oooom.net supports redirect pausing, where you can see the URL you're about to be sent to before you actually go there. You trigger it by adding &#47;pause to the end of the URL (e.g. http:&#47;&#47;b.oooom.net&#47;70&#47;pause). You can save your pause setting in a cookie (I promise it's not evil) so that all URLs are paused automatically - good for work!</p>
<p>URLs can also be marked <abbr title="Not work safe">NWS<&#47;abbr> by the person adding them (and only them) which will pause on redirect every time with a warning that it's dodgy material (also good for work). Of course, you can set a cookie to skip the NWS warning at home.</p>
<p>You can shrink URLs by putting them into the form on the website or by hitting http:&#47;&#47;b.oooom.net&#47;shrink&#47;<your url>.</p>
<p>I shall shortly create eggdrop and irssi scripts to make it easier to do URL shortening by IRC.</p>
