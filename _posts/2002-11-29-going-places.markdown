    Next time you are thirsty like that get off your arse, go out and buy a bottle of some kind.  And refill it.<br &#47;>
    <br &#47;>
    Moral of the story, always carry a drink bottle on your trek.  Refill it when you can.  ;o)<br &#47;>
    <br &#47;>
    Love your work

<p>A <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nicedyke.net&#47;blog&#47;" target="_blank" title="lectique's blog">friend of mine<&#47;a> recently went out to Australia for a bit, which must be a bit bizarre for her as she's English, but has been living in Germany for the last 10 years or something.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
It's also interesting for me, because hearing about .au from someone there is one thing, but hearing about it from someone who you know is another, because they always have an idea of what really makes somewhere else different. Or something like that. She mentions in her blog water being expensive, which is something I remember from when I went to the US a few years back. Part of my trip involved half a week in Chicago by myself (I was meeting up with a guy I knew from IRC, but that was only for one day). I was staying in a Youth Hostel in the North of the city, having made no previous arrangements before going. It was quite exciting actually, and even sitting here writing about it now, I kinda miss it and wish I could go back and do it again (only with more money).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I remember taking the Chicago Metro ('underground') into downtown, and walking around there being amazed at how big&#47;expensive everything was. One of the problems with staying in a Youth Hostel (that I found, anyway) is that food is hard&#47;pricey to come by, and so you have to make sure you eat when you're out and about, or at least buy food. The hostel had a chocolate machine I think, and it also had a water fountain thing that used conical cups... the idea being you couldn't put them down, thus you couldn't fill up with a load of water and take them away, or something like that.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
This was most inconvenient for me, as I was pretty thirsty a lot of the time (due to the start of the heatwave that killed several people the day I left for Indiana), and the fact that my room had a ceiling fan and no air conditioning. I ended up fashioning a cup-holder from the cardboard packaging from the headphones I bought duty-free at Gatwick, and also spare stickers from my luggage labels. It worked quite well, except for the way that by the morning, the water-proof coating on the cup dissolved into the water, and made it taste of cardboard. The moral of the story is, don't run with scissors.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Meanwhile I'm going home this weekend, and then up to London to meet <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.garion.org" target="_blank" title="Garion's Nexus">Garion<&#47;a>, Manic, Duds, Caz, Legooolas, and people. Should be cool, as I haven't seen that lot in a long time&#47;ever.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I miss Roz :(<br &#47;><br />
