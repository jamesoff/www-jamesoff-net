    This was about 10 shots taken with the shutter open for about 4 seconds each, and a small aperture to compensate. After opening the shutter I waved an LCD torch around to make the patterns around the edges.

    Once I'd covered it all, I imported it all into Gimp as layers in a single image and set the layers to Lighten Only (mostly the images came out dark, except for the torch bits), cropped and added the gradient to hide my untidy background, et voila :)
