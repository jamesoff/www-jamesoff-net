<p>Hi James!</p>
<p>just found your quotescript.<br />
i used another script before.<br />
is there any script or something else, to get my "old" quotes (~150) in the<br />
db?</p>
<p>bye,</p>

<p>Always nice to get mail to show people are using my stuff :)</p>
<p>Christoph was kind enough to send me a copy of his old quote database so I wrote him a conversion script. Once I know it works ok I'll include it in the next release of QuoteEngine (and once I know which script he was using, too).</p>
<p>Greg has fixed his CVS issues with bMotion and is committing code now, as are Kev and Shruuf -- hurrah!</p>
