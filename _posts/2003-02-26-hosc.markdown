<p>hosc (Hybrid Oper Script Collection) continues to grow. Yesterday I committed new versions of a couple of scripts, including the operwall script which reformats OPERWALL and LOCOPS notices to separate windows, and anything you type in those windows is sent to the appropriate group.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The connection tracking script (ho_track) still needs more work. It uses Bayesian probabilities to try to work out if a client is a drone or not, but it generates either high numbers (0.8), or incredibly low (0.000004), and only a small part of the incredibly low numbers are positives. Definitely needs more thought.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Having played with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gallery.sf.net" target="_top">Gallery<&#47;a> a bit, I will be doing a bit of tidying up on the picssite. It seems to have lost some of the "fun" it used to have, so I shall try to give it a bit more personality. Watch this space.</p>
