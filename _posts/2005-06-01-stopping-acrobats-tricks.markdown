<p>Generating a PDF by printing to the Adobe PDF Printer makes it open the finished PDF in Acrobat afterwards. This stops being so useful if (like Roz) you have to make a lot of PDFs and don't need them opened in Acrobat afterwards.</p>
<p>To stop it from doing this, open the Properties window for the PDF Printer, click Printing Preferences... and then uncheck View Adobe PDF Results.</p>
