<p>It's not exactly confidence inspiring for Amazon's A9 search engine that if you put "Living with Michael Jackson" into amazon.co.uk it says</p>
<blockquote><p>We found no matches for "living with michael jackson" .  Below are results for "with" .  If you prefer, you may try another search.<&#47;blockquote> and then suggests a wireless ADSL router and an iPod.</p>
