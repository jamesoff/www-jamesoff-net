    Hello,
    Just wondering if anyone could help. I did something stupid and started my blog using a numerical archive system, and now I&#39;d like to change it so that the post title is part of the URL for SEO reasons. Is there any Wordpress plugins that anyone knows of that could switch it without sending Googlers to invalid pages? Maybe some sort of redirector to the correct page?

    Thanks.
