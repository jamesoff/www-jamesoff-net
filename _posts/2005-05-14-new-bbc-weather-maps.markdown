    I don't think they know what they're doing!

    I find the new maps horrible, and so do many other people.

    There is a new Google bomb campaign underway to get ugly graphics to point to the BBC Weather page!

    Explanation and instructions here:

    Don't Googlebomb with my blog, thanks. Removed the link to the BBC Weather page.

<p>According to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.bbc.co.uk&#47;1&#47;hi&#47;entertainment&#47;tv_and_radio&#47;4546141.stm">BBC News<&#47;a> from Monday they're going to be replacing the old maps with new 3D ones. Shame, the old symbols are amazing because they're so easily recognisable  compared to some of the other weather programmes' symbols.</p>
<p>I'm sure they know what they're doing.</p>
