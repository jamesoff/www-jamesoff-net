<p><b>Updates to site:<&#47;b><br &#47;></p>
<ul>
<li>I've updated the code for b2 to hopefully fix the IE-doesn't-refresh problem using the fix on the b2 forums.<&#47;li><br &#47;></p>
<li>I've switched on TrackBack and PingBack now that I understand how they work<&#47;li><br &#47;>
<li>I was going to switch on blog-by-email but site5's email server isn't fully RFC compliant so it's not working at the moment :(<&#47;li><br &#47;><br />
<&#47;ul><br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Back to work for now :)</p>
