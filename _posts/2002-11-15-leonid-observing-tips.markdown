<p><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.grooblehonk.co.uk&#47;blog_images&#47;weblog-20021115.jpg" border=2 alt="Meteors, perhaps." align="right" &#47;>NASA has published a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;science.nasa.gov&#47;headlines&#47;y2002&#47;14nov_leonidtips.htm">page<&#47;a> explaining the best way to observe the Leonid Metor show on Tuesday 19th, so I thought I'd add some of my own advice:<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;></p>
<ol><br &#47;></p>
<li>Look up: If you look at the ground you won't see many, due to them all being in the sky. Also, the chance of you being struck on the head by an errant meteor is greatly increased.<&#47;li><br &#47;>
<li>Go outside: See above<&#47;li><br &#47;>
<li>Don't wear sunglasses<&#47;li><br &#47;>
<li>Buy an enormous telescope: This may help, and if it doesn't you can always use it for other things (e.g. observing sunspots)<&#47;li><br &#47;>
<li>Use a sleeping bag: But don't forget to unzip it else you won't be able to see out.<&#47;li><br &#47;>
<li>Don't look at the moon: it's not a Leonid Meteor, although it is considerably easier to see. Perhaps you should look at the moon if you can't see any meteors.<&#47;li><br &#47;>
<li>Be outside the atmosphere: You should be able to accomplish this with a super-big spring. Don't forget to take a thermos.<&#47;li><br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
