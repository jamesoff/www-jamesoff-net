<p>Last week at work we went up onto Dartmoor and took some pics of our sysadmin with his laptop (for the cover of Hard Copy), and I took some pics of the scenery too. I've put them up on Deviant art for everyone to enjoy, hurrah!<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
They're <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.deviantart.com&#47;deviation&#47;1225163" target="_blank">here<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.deviantart.com&#47;deviation&#47;1225151" target="_blank">here<&#47;a>.</p>
