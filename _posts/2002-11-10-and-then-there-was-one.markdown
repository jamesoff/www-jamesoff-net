<p>Roz and Dudley left earlier today... it's amazing how quickly I become used to Roz being around, which makes it very lonely when she's gone :(<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Did you know Christmas is just about 6 weeks away? I know this because I bought Roz a ring for her birthday (in addition to her new webcam, I am now officially the poorest man in my room). Unfortunately her finger size is like "O.5" (that's "O and a half", not "zero point five") so they've got to order in the right size, and we suspect they'll have to make it (rather than having it in stock) so that means six weeks until it arrives... in Exeter. Perhaps I can give it to her as a Christmas present instead :P<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If anyone wants to know, my ring size is apparently V.5 for my middle finger. I like Japanese patterns, thanks. ;)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Now up to 32 hours of play time on FFX, go me :)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Apparently my mould dances when I'm not looking.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I see lectique has linked me on her blog, so here's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.househistory.de&#47;blog&#47;">a link back<&#47;a> until I get my links on the right-hand menu sorted properly.</p>
