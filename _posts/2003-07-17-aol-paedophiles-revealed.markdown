<p>The BBC have identified the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;news.bbc.co.uk&#47;1&#47;hi&#47;uk&#47;3073603.stm" target="_blank">phases of a paedophile<&#47;a> on the prowl for a poor innocent defenceless child. However, they present it only in abstract form so I have translated it into the exact phrases that are more likely to be found in a chatroom.</p>
<p><b>1: Friendship: Flattering a child into a private chatroom <&#47;b><br />
"OMG ur hot!!1"</p>
<p><b>2: Relationship-forming: Asking the child what problems they have <&#47;b><br />
"ur mom sux lol"</p>
<p><b>3: Mutuality: Identifying with those problems to create bond <&#47;b><br />
"me too"</p>
<p><b>4: Risk-assessment: Asking about location of computer etc <&#47;b><br />
"asl??????&#47;"</p>
<p><b>5: Exclusivity: Using powerful language to create trust and often love <&#47;b><br />
"u wanna fuck? im takin my pants off........."</p>
<p><b>6: Starting sex chat <&#47;b><br />
"lol touch me their im hot :))))"</p>
