<p>I've decided to quit my Fitness First membership, and they're making it difficult. I'm just not using it as much as the membership fee demands (since I'm playing a lot of badminton at the moment, and cycling to&#47;from badminton too), so I decided to save myself &pound;30 a month. And spend it on hard drives.</p>
<p>So I wrote them a polite (but terse) letter, in LaTeX no less - I'm not sure they'll have appreciated the careful typesetting and wotnot, especially since it was let down by our printer's insistence on making everything it prints corrugated and also adding a dashing grey strip down the edge.</p>
<p>Roz handed it in yesterday for me, and this evening they called me to discuss it. Instead of the usual "oh please don't leave" or "please state 489 unique reasons why you're leaving" stuff, they were phoning to let me know that my assertion that December's payment would be my last was incorrect, and that I was going to have to pay January's too.</p>
<p>Bollocks to that.</p>
<p>Apparently I signed a 12 month contract because of the membership level I'm on ("Corporate" - because Roz gets that via her job, and FF allow you to apply it to a family member). This is interesting because on the carbon copy I have, it shows three and 12 month options, and clearly circled is "Corporate" and "3". Roz's contract has the same, so it's not like it was an error on just mine.</p>
<p>When I offered to bring my copy down and show them, they said that the manager had "just left" and I'd have to bring it in tomorrow evening instead. I shall be dropping in on my way back from work with the proof. And one way or another I'm cancelling my direct debit payment after December's payment clears.</p>
