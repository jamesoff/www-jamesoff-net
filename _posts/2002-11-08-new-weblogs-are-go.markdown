<p>Whee, this is pretty cool.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I've switched from the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;forums&#47;">forums system<&#47;a> to this because it's more what I wanted. The forums'll still be doing forumy things, and some people may be using the weblogs there, but I'm going to hold my weblogs over here; it fits more closely with what I want.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I've felt that just posting random links and stuff to my weblog on the old system was a bit clunky because it added a whole new thread, and adding it as a reply to that thread didn't make it obvious to people that I'd replied rather than someone else had commented on it.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
As usual, a lot's happened since I posted last on my weblog (forums-style), and I'm not going to bother recapping now. If you're on IRC then you'll probably know the important stuff, and if you're not it probably doesn't affect you immediately ;)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The current news is that I've moved from the product support team to the development team <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.greymatter.com">at work<&#47;a>. They needed extra manpower to help finish the new website in time so I was drafted. My time there keeps being extended at the moment, and I'm rather hoping they'll make it permanent as I'd rather be there than in support. (No offense John :P)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Roz is down visiting at the moment, Dudley's on his way as I type, and Phil's coming to visit tomorrow, nice to have old friends back together even if it's only for a day or so.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
In other news, I seem to have some form of mould growing in the corner of my room so I'll have to go shoot Leaman Marks (letting agents) in the head about that tomorrow. They still owe us net&#47;regular curtains in the lounge too. I shall post a picture of my mould if I can work out how to do it with this infernal blog software :)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
That is all.</p>
