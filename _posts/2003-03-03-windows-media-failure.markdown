<p>I bought a load of my CDs back to Exeter with me from home last week, and thought I should listen to some. So I fired up WMP9 to listen to them, and asked it to download the album information from the net (as much out of curiosity to see what it would do as wanting the track names). I was presented with the following:<br &#47;><br />
<img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.grooblehonk.co.uk&#47;blog_images&#47;wmp-huh.jpg" border="0" alt="What?" &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
WHAT? I already own this CD, it's in my CD drive you moronic bit of software! Why would I want to buy it?</p>
