<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.infoworld.com">InfoWorld<&#47;a> is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.infoworld.com&#47;article&#47;04&#47;01&#47;28&#47;HNiehole_1.html">reporting<&#47;a> that there's another hole in MSIE which lets someone mask the type of a file you're downloading. Combined with the address-bar-spoofing flaw, this could be really dangerous.</p>
<p>In other news, jamesoff.net now has an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;spf.pobox.com&#47;" title="SMTP+Sender Permitted From">SPF<&#47;a> record, and I'm looking at SPF filtering on my mailserver. There's a Perl script that's supposed to do filtering by picking up headers, but 90% of the time it doesn't work so I guess I shall be writing my own ;)</p>
