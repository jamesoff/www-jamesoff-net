<p>I knew this was coming, but seeing it happen makes me a sad panda.</p>
<p>http:&#47;&#47;www.sysinternals.com now redirects to a Microsoft :xbox: TechNet site. While the new site carries all of the stuff sysinternals.com had, and also has some new stuff (hooray!) it's sad to see it finally gone :(</p>
<p>Luckily, nothing ever really [dies on the Internet](http:&#47;&#47;web.archive.org&#47;web&#47;20060428003456&#47;http:&#47;&#47;www.sysinternals.com&#47;)!</p>
