<p>Wow, my previous post about phone spam has attracted quite a few comments, including [this one from a guy who works for the company in question](http:&#47;&#47;blog.jamesoff.net&#47;archives&#47;2005&#47;12&#47;22&#47;phone-spam#comment-28760)! At least that company is aware of how much they're annoying people, not that I suspect it'll ever stop them from doing it to more people.</p>
<p>Yesterday on my new(ish) Vodafone phone I got a call from `02920368705` with the usual spiel about they're calling "about your Vodafone contract" and could they save me money&#47;cut me a deal&#47;please god give us some money. At least the guy who made the call was up for a laugh because when I told him I liked spending money he offered me a plan that was &Acirc;&pound;1,000 per month with one free minute and one free SMS. After persuading him that I didn't want that either and would he please remove me from his list, he went.</p>
<p>According to results from Google, this number belongs to Communications Direct which is a different company to the last one I had time.</p>
<p>Why not do a [Google Search](http:&#47;&#47;www.google.co.uk&#47;search?hl=en&q=Communications+Direct) for them and click their sponsored link? I'm sure they can afford it. :10bux:</p>
