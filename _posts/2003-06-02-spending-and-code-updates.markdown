<p>Heh well Roz has booked a nice holiday to Corfu... which made it much easier for me to justify spending &pound;40 on a new badminton racket on Saturday. This was also made even better by my parents SMSing me from Spain to say they'd just bought an apartment out there.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Today I had a look online for the racket I bought, and the RRP was &pound;100, so I'm quite pleased with that.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Last night I updated the code for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thepicssite.com">thepicssite<&#47;a> with some more of the changes I've been meaning to make for a bit. This gave me an excellent excuse to add the code to a local CVS repository with TortoiseCVS. I've been meaning to track my websites with CVS for a while now.</p>
