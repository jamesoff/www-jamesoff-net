  content: And they didn't let you bring Roz to partner day?

<p>What a waste of a day, this partner day I've been sent on is fine if you already know these products and the company but isn't a very good introduction. Plus they've changed the schedule and I could have played badminton tonight probably. Still at least I get to try updating this site from my mobile :)</p>
