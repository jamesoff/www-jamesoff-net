    Have had a call from these annoying individuals today myself - I'm on Orange..

    If you haven't already tried - one of the following tips may help reduce future calls of a similar nature..

    1. Make sure your mobile phone number is on the TPS database (Telephone Preference Service) - http:&#47;&#47;www.tpsonline.org.uk
    It's a free service, can be done online in less than 2 minutes - SO THERE IS NO EXCUSE NOT TO..

    The more people that register their mobile numbers - and then complain - the better.

    2. If you can be bothered - call Orange customer services and report the call as a nuisance call. (This is a long and tedious process - usually involving a callback).

    3.  better still call orange and report the dealer to the dealer support team for using a random dialler. From the conversations I've had I believe Orange take a dim view of this type of practice.

    4. Ask Orange to put a lock on your account.  Basically they have a mechanism to stop anyone else (ie these types of dealer or reseller) making changes to your account (it only allows Orange themselves).

    be a wrong number as they never spoke when I answered my mobile. Rang at about
    11.23am on 26.01.06. If they call again, now I know who they are I will give them
    my polite no! If they get pushy get their name and ask to speak to their manager
    about being cold called. Orange never cold call, they know better than that. If
    they don't want to be cooperative sign off the call by saying you will call Orange
    Customer services and Oftel to complain about them and put the phone down. Cold
    callers learn not to call me..... Alternatively, just put the phone down next
    to the radio and carry on doing whatever you were doing. They called so it's their
    bill.

What gets me is that they claim to be calling 'on behalf' of another phone company offering you contracts&#47;deals, but why the hell would they call a 13 year old kid offering a contract?. It's ludicrous.

    Had two of these calls yesterday and today. Both hung up.

    Strangely, last week called by Orange (so they said) to offer me a 10% discount on my calls as a 'valued customer'. They wanted me to confirm my details but clearly did not have them on their screen.

    I gave my basic details. They then said they would pass me on to someone else. At this stage I hung up.

    They rang back a couple of times but I ignored the calls.

    I e-mailed Orange who replied by telling me to phone 150. I haven't yet.

    Are the two connected? Anyone else with similar calls?

    Apparantly the number 0800 4584727 is owned by Opal Telecom Limited, a company which was acquired by The Carphone Warehouse in November 2002.

    This means all these calls people have been getting could well be the carphone warehouse secretly researching its competitors and trying to poach customers, claiming to be affiliated with each persons own network to gain confidence.

    02081812010 keep pestering us with silent calls, we report all these to ofcom hoping that if enough people complain then something may get done about it, see below
    Problems with your landline phone -
    Silent calls (when you answer the phone, there is nobody there)When the phone rings and you pick up the receiver to hear silence at the other end, most people understandably fear the worst. Silent calls can be very frightening, particularly for people who live alone.

    In the vast majority of cases, these silent calls are not made by pranksters, burglars or stalkers. In fact they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re simply the work of a machine, called a predictive dialler, used by call centres to phone large numbers of people in one go.

    Predictive diallers are used by telemarketing firms (who phone people up to try to persuade them to buy products or services), by market research firms, by debt collection agencies and many other types of company. They work by dialling telephone numbers automatically, then connecting the customer to a call centre agent as soon as the customer answers the phone. Unfortunately, if all the call centre agents are busy when the customer answers the phone, there&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nobody free at the other end of the line when the customer picks up the receiver. So as a result, the customer simply hears silence - and can be concerned or frightened as a result.

    Even if people know there is nothing to fear, the fact remains that silent calls are very disruptive and irritating. They can also be illegal, particularly if a company is making large numbers of silent calls. Ofcom is determined to take action against companies who break the law.

    On 1 March 2006 Ofcom announced new measures to help protect people from silent calls. The new rules have been put in place to ensure companies who use automated calling systems use them responsibly. Ofcom&acirc;&euro;&trade;s aim is to significantly reduce the total number of silent calls and to enable people to clearly identify the source of any silent call that they receive.

    For more details on the new rules please visit: http:&#47;&#47;www.ofcom.org.uk&#47;media&#47;news&#47;2006&#47;03&#47;nr_20060301.

    Im pretty sure Adam Smith is right about who is behind the 02081812010.
    I entered a comp online with Classic FM and gave my mobile number, since then i have received a few calls from this number.
    Maybe we should all call Classic FM, and give them the same treatment!

    Hello Everyone

    Firstly sincere apologies for the nuisance we have obvioulsy been causing people with our magazine subscription calls. We do not wish to annoy anyone with our calls so here is a little explanation about us,

    While we do admit we have a drop rate on calls which will result in a silent call we keep well within the allowed limit directed by Ofcom.

    We are a small 14 year old telemarketing company and are very proud of our policies on our calling activities as we are keen to ensure that we, unlike many larger UK and offshore companies, make every effort to abide by guidelines and rules set out for companies such as ourselves.


    We abide by (including compliant equipment) with Ofcom regulations for automated diallers. We follow the DMA guidelines on TPS lists. We do not undertake any cold calling as we are contracted to call numbers supplied by existing customers or those with an established relationship to the companies we work for.

    Again please accept my sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused, if you would be kind enough to supply the telephone numbers that we have been calling you all on we will add it to our Do Not Call list, ensuring you will not be called again by us.

    customercare@ctc-telemarketing.com

    Thank you all for taking the trouble to read this apology

    Justin Young

    regarding following regulations and with the greatest of respect to you we are
    not \"slimeballs\".\n\nI have looked into the call made to you and you are a current
    customer of Futurenet Magazines with an established and long standing relationship.
    The telephone number we called you on was supplied by yourself at the time of
    subscribing to the magazine (ie, we did not get your number from any third party
    source such as direct enquiries).\n\nFurther to that and more importantly at the
    time of subscribing you would have either been asked (if you ordered over the
    phone) various data protection questions or if you subscribed by post you would
    have had the same options given to you.  In either case you gave Futurenet or
    its representatives permission to make contact with you by phone. There is therefore
    no requirement to screen your number against the TPS file.\n\nI repeat my apology
    for inconveniencing you and so that we can change the status of your subscription
    and customer record held at Futurenet to that where no calls should be received
    by you if this is what you now require, please supply the number you wish to have
    blocked and we will add it to our Do Not Call list and request the Futurenet amend
    their records as well.\n\nKind regards\n\nJustin Young"

    RE: Post 56,

    Thanks I have been receiving constant calls during the day when I am out, Today I received 7 calls at various times in the day, I was able to answer 3 of them, 2 were immidiately dead, 1 was a giggly girl "Hi is MR, giggle... " hung up.

    This was the last resort, Whatever your selling I dont want it, Im in TPS, I reported you to OFCOM, and rung the number listed '0208 541 4777' and roasted 'Gloria' who was the lady on the other end of the phone, she claims to have removed my number from their system, and explained I was getting these calls due to an expired subscription to Xbox360 Mag (future publishing). I will not buy from ANYONE if im pestered, and I preffer messages left on my answerphone so I can call back if interested.

    I have operated both 'Amcat' and 'Strata-Soft' dialing engines and Never have I come across such poor usage of an amazing tool, I hope you get fined for pestering TPS clients.

    asked for my bank details to be confirmed over the phone. CTC are a call centre
    who contact lapsed subscibers and can offer special deals to win you back. It
    was tempting but they went on to ask for my bank details to set up a Direct Debit,
    I told them that it was normal practice to a customer fill in a mandate and sign
    it but they were adamant that this could all be done on the phone. Thats when
    I told them I did not want to do this at I had no guarantee they were who they
    said they were and CTC then gave me their website to check them out and their
    return telephone number 0208 541 4777. The website www.ctc-telmarketing.com did
    not give any addition information than the phone call had. I have decided not

    After reading what Jan wrote on 30th October '06, it seems like I have given the phone out to a company who has passed it on, naive of me to think that because it's a mobile phone they wouldn't bother me as it would be too expensive for them.  I was wrong!

    I've just had a call from the 0208 1812010 number. The first one ever (Hopefully the last).

    As other people have stated in the above forum I could hear office noises in the background.

    However, the bloke on the phone actually used my name:-
    "Hi, Can I speak with 'John Smith' please".
    I said, "Yes, Speaking", and they hung up.

    Very spooky.

    I have reported this call to TPS.
