<p>Is nothing sacred? It now seems that people are spamming by creating users on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;forums.jamesoff.net" title="my forums">my forums<&#47;a>, with the URL of their spamvertised site in the URL field of their profile.</p>
<p><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.grooblehonk.co.uk&#47;blog_images&#47;forumspam.png" alt="Forum spam users" &#47;></p>
<p>No doubt this is done in some kind of batch fashion. To prevent it for now I've enabled email-based authentication on phpBB and I'm deleting the accounts (about 20 of them) manually.</p>
<p>Fucking spamers :(</p>
