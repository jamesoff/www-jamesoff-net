  content: I've posted about this on my Livejournal too, and I'm hoping that they'll
    get at least a little bit of bad "press" for this.  Maybe I should report them
    to Watchdog, and whatever ombudsman there is for letting agencies.

<p>Congratulations to Becky and Dave who finally got Dave's sizable deposit ,-* back from [Weekes](http:&#47;&#47;www.weekesestateagents.co.uk&#47;) Estate Agents after 9 months delay and a lot of being told "yeah the cheque's in the post" and "oh the guy who writes those cheques isn't in the office&#47;is busy&#47;has no arms&#47;possibly never existed today".</p>
<p>Success was finally achieved by (after they slipped on their promise of doing a bank transfer last week) Becky visiting the office in person and demanding to be given the cheque. No news yet on if it's bounced or not...</p>
<p>Read it from the horse's keyboard [here](http:&#47;&#47;legooolas.livejournal.com&#47;2521.html)</p>
