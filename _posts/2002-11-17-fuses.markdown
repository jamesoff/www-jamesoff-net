<p><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.grooblehonk.co.uk&#47;blog_images&#47;weblog-20021117.gif" border="0" alt="Fuse :P" align="right" &#47;>I fixed by TV&#47;FM (Damo's actually) booster so I can listen to the radio again now. I also recabled the aerial for the radio so I get an "amazing" 46db signal for Radio 1, much more competent. The solution was to steal the fuse from the PSX's power cable (5A fuse required).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I also spent a very pleasant afternoon hacking on some TCL; NoTopic now runs the Afronym game in #efnetgirl on EFNet, after Afrobawt (who ran it originally) went AWOL. Unfortunately we never got the script for it, so I just wrote my own instead :P Hopefully it'll be fine (*waves hand) but noone's actually been around to play it yet.<br &#47;><br />
