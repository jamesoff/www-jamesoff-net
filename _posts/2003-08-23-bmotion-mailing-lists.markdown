<p>I've set up a mailing list for users of bMotion, and another for developers. bMotion users can subscribe by sending a blank email to bmotion-users-subscribe@jamesoff.net and developers should contact me for how to subscribe. Subscription to the developers list isn't restricted to people who are members of the SourceForge project; anyone who is writing code for the bot can join.</p>
