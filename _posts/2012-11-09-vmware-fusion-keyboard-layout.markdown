If you're using VMware Fusion and can't get the keyboard layout right in your VM (especially if you can't get backslash to show up), try my [Happy Hacking UK layout](http://jamesoff.net/site/code/windows/happy-hacking-uk-layout). This gives me the correct layout on my MBP at least :)

My MBP has the `\` key (`shift-\` is `|`) above the return key and to the right of the `]` key. Note that because this is the UK layout, it makes `shift-2` generate double-quote `"`, and shift-single-quote generate `@`. For personal reasons, `shift-3` generates hash `#`. To obtain the GBP Sterling currency symbol `Â£`, use `right alt-3`.
