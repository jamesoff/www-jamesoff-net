<p>Ars Technica reports on the new-look Google which you can <a href="http:&#47;&#47;arstechnica.com&#47;news.ars&#47;post&#47;20060326-6460.html">preview their new search layout<&#47;a> by hacking around with some JavaScript. This is the new layout I saw once by accidenta few weeks ago, but I couldn't make Google repeat it and I didn't take a screenshot (D'oh).</p>
<p>Nice to see I wasn't making it up, at least :)</p>
