<p>I'm trying out the latest beta of IE7 to make sure it works OK with stuff I do for my job, and the tab support in it is infuritating me.</p>
<p>In Firefox, I can drag the favicon from the address bar or a link from a page into a blank area of the tab bar, and I'll get a new tab with my link it.</p>
<p>In IE, that opens in the link in the currently active tab.</p>
<p>OK, so how about if I drop the link over the "new tab" button? No, that opens the link in the active tab too.</p>
<p>Alright then, I'll create a tab with the new tab button myself, and then I'll drop the link into the blank tab.</p>
<p>Wait, no, that doesn't do it either. The only way to open a link in a new tab is to Ctrl-click it. All of the other actions for opening a new tab make sense to me from a UI point of view, but just don't work.</p>
