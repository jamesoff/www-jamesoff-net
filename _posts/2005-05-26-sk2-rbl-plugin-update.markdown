<p>After a good evening's coding last night I've got a working version of the Spam Karma 2 RBL plugin which looks IPs and URIs up in different RBLs, and can also submit back to blbl.org when it finds a spammy comment.</p>
<p>Still got some testing to do and also tidying up the code, adding options etc to do. Hopefully I'll put a version for testing up shortly.</p>
<p>Related to the above, I've changed blbl.org to list IPs under bl.blbl.org and URIs under uri-bl.blbl.org. I shall be giving the blbl.org site a bit of a facelift soon.</p>
