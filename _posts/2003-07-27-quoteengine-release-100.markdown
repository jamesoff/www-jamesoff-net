<p>Now announcing the release of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;go&#47;quoteengine">QuoteEngine 1.00<&#47;a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The QuoteEngine is an eggdrop TCL script (with an optional php-based web interface) that allows channel users (with the right flags) to store IRC quotes in a mySQL database. Adding, searching, fetching, and deletion from the channel are supported. Multiple channel support is native. <&#47;blockquote></p>
