<p>BMW replied to my email about the spammer who posted on my forums, but they said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have not been aware of the web site http:&#47;&#47;bmw-portl and-oregon.flgju.info&#47;index.html. However, this domain is not accessible and therefore, we cannot undertake any further actions.<&#47;blockquote><br />
Sorry, but the site still works for me, although it's a bit slow. I've emailed them a screenshot showing it.</p>
