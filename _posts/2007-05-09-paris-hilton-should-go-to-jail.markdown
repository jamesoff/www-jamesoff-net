  content: She deserves to go to jail she violated her probation. There would be no
    justice and no lesson learned. She should have went to jail when she got sentenced!

  content: 'This web site should now be: Paris Hilton should go BACK to jail.  Can''t
    believe a few tears and lots of money will bail her out like this...Martha Stewart
    should have known this trick.  Has Paris Hilton gained ANY insight to her behaviour,
    and to her other more meaningful purposes to life than just selling a superficial
    image to young minds? I hope those tears were geniune tears of a rude awakening&#47;
    realization that her life is shallower that she once knew.  Please be a TRUE role
    model Paris, without your make-up, fake persona, and alcohol.'

    There's a simple equation here, and it doesn't involve anything to do with fame or fans:

    violate probation -> jail.

<p>> Celebrity heiress Paris Hilton is backing an online petition seeking a pardon of her 45-day prison sentence because she enlivens "mundane" lives.</p>
<p>Everyone enlivens the lives of everyone around them, Paris no more or no less than anyone else.</p>
<p>> Hilton was sentenced after being found guilty of violating her probation for a drink-driving conviction.</p>
<p>> Ms Hilton told the judge she was very sorry and that she would "pay complete attention to everything" from now on.</p>
<p>Oh NOW you're going to pay attention to what the court tells you? Fuck off to jail already.</p>
