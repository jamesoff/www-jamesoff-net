<p>Well, the spam is pretty much all done with now... still getting bounces and undeliverables coming in slowly, but I'm not sure if they're the last from the joe job, or if it's new general background noise I'm going to have to put up with.</p>
<p>Here's some pretty pictures of how hard I was hit:</p>

The spike at the 27th is when the flood started and after 7000 messages my ADSL died. It was off all week until Friday afternoon, which is the spike at 31 Oct and 1 Nov. By the 2nd and 3rd it had pretty much blown itself out.</p>

Ouch. (The high count in August is because of SoBig and other viruses taking off.)</p>
<p>This just in from bMotion's new joke plugin (by simsea):</p>

Sort of makes sense, doesn't it?</p>
