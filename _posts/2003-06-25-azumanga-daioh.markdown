    Hi, do you think it is possible if you could write out the subtitles for azumanga daioh in english for me? because the version that i got is in spanish and i do not understand spanish.
    thanks so much

    Dude, I love love love Azumanga Daioh! It's ssoooo cool, I love all the characters especially Tomo cos she's all hyper and stuff. But I love Chiyo-chan cos Jessica Boone is my fav voice actress. You can prolly tell that i'm bored cos i'm just rambling on to myself, oh well! ^_^


    P.S
    Azumanga rocks!!

    If you think Azumaanga Daioh is anywhere near the best anime ever, you would be absolutely right! Azumanga Daioh ROCKS! Read the manga if you  haven't already. My fav is Sakaki-san. She's so SUPER COOOOL!!
                                                      WAI! WAI!

<br &#47;><br />
This is probably the best anime series I have ever seen, for every reason available. It's very well drawn, the Japanese is clear, (the fansubs are excellent,) it's funny, well voiced, has very good music, and is very addictive.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
There are only 26 episodes but I managed to make them last a few months, and I'm very glad I did. I'm also very sad it's over T_T<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I shall have to watch it again very soon... I'm getting withdrawal just knowing there isn't any more to watch.<br clear="left" &#47;></p>
