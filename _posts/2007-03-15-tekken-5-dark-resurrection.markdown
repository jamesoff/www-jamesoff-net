    certain of this by playing at least 5 iterations of each option?

<p>This evening I played some Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection on a friend's PSP. It's definitely one of the reasons I would buy one if I was feeling richer. Tekken on the go is the best idea ever.</p>
<p>I was amused to note (in passing only of course) that while selecting Xaioyu with the right shoulder button selects the schoolgirl outfit, using the left shoulder button selected the same outfit but with some anti-gravity skirt or something, as it seemed to be revealing a lot more than usual. Perhaps it was a windy level I was playing on :v:</p>
