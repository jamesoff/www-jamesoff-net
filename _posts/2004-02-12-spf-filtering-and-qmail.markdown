<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;archives.listbox.com&#47;spf-discuss@v2.listbox.com&#47;200401&#47;1418.html">This post<&#47;a> on the SPF-discuss list has a patch for doing SPF filtering at SMTP-time in qmail-smtpd, which is nice. I've got it running on the new mail gateway at work and it hasn't broken anything yet. Unfortunately the takeup of SPF is still on the low side to it's hard to say if it's having much effect yet, but at least I'm ready for it when it is :)</p>
