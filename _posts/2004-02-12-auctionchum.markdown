<p>Over the last couple of weeks, Roz and I have been developing a new site called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.auctionchum.com">AuctionChum<&#47;a> designed to help people selling stuff on auction sites (mainly eBay, but we'll be adding support for other sites soon).</p>
<p>Today it goes beta so that other people can try it out and we can see if it's going in the right direction. Head on over and check it out if you're interested! :)</p>
