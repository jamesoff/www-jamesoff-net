<blockquote>14:18 [ ripe-prom] just composing my letter to fitness first<br &#47;><br />
14:18 [ ripe-prom] asking to cancel my membership<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Dear sir&#47;madam,<br &#47;><br />
Having spent some time as a member of the fitness first gym I find myself regrettably requesting<br &#47;><br />
to cancel my membership.  Many a time I've enjoyed furthering my physical prowess at your Exeter branch in particular so it is with a heavy heart that I ask this of you.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
This is not due to any poor service or lack of excellent facilities but instead, down to my moving to southern Bhutan.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Unfortunately for me, I do not think there are any fitness first branches out near the Himalayas so it would be silly for me to keep my membership active whilst struggling to find grubs to skewer for the village feast.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
If of course this assumption is incorrect please feel free to send me literature pertaining to the Bhutanese branch of Fitness First, I believe the best language to use would be Sanskrit or the Hinduistic perversion of Tibetan, so that I can recruit more members and gain sunbed vouchers and some of the many other excellent promotions you have on offer.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Many thanks and my unending love to all staff,<br &#47;><br />
Yours ravishingly,<br &#47;><br />
