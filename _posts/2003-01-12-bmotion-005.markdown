<p>bMotion 0.0.5 is out!<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;bmotion.sourceforge.net">See here :)<&#47;a><br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
* optimised events.tcl a bit to be more efficient<br &#47;><br />
* switched the way bMotion represents its version to make it more consistent for<br &#47;><br />
  proper releases etc<br &#47;><br />
* adjusted the light plugin<br &#47;><br />
* moved question handler to plugin<br &#47;><br />
* moved pinches to a plugin<br &#47;><br />
* moved asl trigger to a plugin<br &#47;><br />
* tidied up code a bit<br &#47;><br />
- no longer tracking chanmood, because it was rubbish<br &#47;><br />
* smileys now handled by a plugin (new regexps included)<br &#47;><br />
* New routine to clean []s in nicks, should be more reliable<br &#47;><br />
+ Clean nicks for all entry points, not just event_main<br &#47;><br />
* bMotion won't greet someone if nothing else has been said since it greeted <br &#47;><br />
  last<br &#47;><br />
+ bMotion looks for modules&#47;settings_<botnet -nick>.tcl too (and loads it after<br &#47;><br />
  settings.tcl). You can use this to prevent overwriting your bot's settings<br &#47;><br />
  when installing a new version of the code, and also to run more than one<br &#47;><br />
  bot off the same installation of bMotion.<br &#47;><br />
  For this to work, you MUST define the botnet-nick setting in your eggdrop's<br &#47;><br />
  config file. Remember that it will be case sensitive, so if I have my botnet<br &#47;><br />
  nick set to "NoTopic" the file has to be settings_NoTopic.tcl<br &#47;><br />
+ same as above for abstracts.tcl (if you want to augment an existing one,<br &#47;><br />
  use lappend not set (man lappend for more info)  <&#47;botnet></p>
