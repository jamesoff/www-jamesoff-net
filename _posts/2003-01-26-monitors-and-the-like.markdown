<p>Feh, my Hansol (refurb) has been flickering and stuff recently, and I was hoping it would last a few more months at least, but it died on my last night :(<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Luckily I had a spare monitor on the server I could use, but it wasn't amazing. I went to PC World today and spotted a nice LG 15" TFT for &pound;230. One quick transaction later (12 months interest free, thank you very much), I was TFT-enabled. It's a drop in resolution (down to 1024x768), but the TFT more than makes up for it and I'm doing fine so far. It's definitely much easier on the eyes. You can see it <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;go&#47;monitor" target="_blank">here<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I also wrote a short link hander for JamesOff.net, so that I can have URLs of the form http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;go&#47;<something> and it'll redirect to the right place (the monitor link above is one such thing). I can also redirect based on a numeric id (the monitor is http:&#47;&#47;www.jamesoff.net&#47;go&#47;4). I may open it up publicly if people are interested, although there are similar established services.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
bMotion and TopicEngine continue to prove quite popular, with a new version of the TopicEngine (1.18) ready to release today I think. It's been live on #exeter for a week and seems ready to rock. I'm also writing it a proper homepage on JamesOff.net (which is actually why I wrote that quickjump thing).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Two other people are contributing to bMotion in a serious fashion now, simsea and sabre2th. It's a strange feeling having other people working on it. For the last two years or so now, it's been "my" project, and I've known it inside-out, all 11000 lines of code. Now I have to let it go and entrust other people to keep it going. I have no doubts at all that they're up to the task, but it's just such a strange feeling :) It'll be nice to see how bMotion evolves from this point, because I have big things planned for it (code-wise, that is)...<br &#47;><br />
