    <p>What's really frightening is the database design, it breaks every rule there is about how to design databases.  Nothing ever works right - automated processes are always a problem, they don't run on all our contacts.<&#47;p>

    <p>GoldMine is a piece of garbage. It's probably the worst software I have ever used (just slightly worse than Norton Anti-Virus). I hate it. The whole thing is just thoughtlessly slapped together. GoldMine 7 has a bug that causes about 30 "check that gmres.dll can be found in the PATH enviroment variable" (yes, "enviroment" is spelled wrong in the error message) errors a day in the Windows Event Log on ALL of our workstations, including our Terminal Server (VERY BAD!). The PATH environment variable for gmres.dll is correctly set on all workstations, but it still insists on spitting out AT LEAST 10 errors per workstation per day. The program takes about 1 minute to reach the friggin' login screen. I experience GoldMine crashes weekly. Emails are stored oddly. The activity preview window in the activity list shows "[email unavailable]" or some crap like that until you go to complete the activity. Then it transfers the email to the preview window or something, and then if you cancel the completion and re-open the activity, all of the information is suddenly missing out of there, so you have to copy and paste it from the preview window.<&#47;p>

    <p>Don't even get me started on GISMO (GoldMine's terrible attempt to link Outlook emails to the database) or there other MS Office link attempts. They consistently cause all sorts of weird MS Office malfunctions for our users.<&#47;p>

    <p>I think I am going to start taking a screenshot of every retarded GoldMine problem and compile them into a blog post on my website (http:&#47;&#47;www.x3haloed.com&#47;).<&#47;p>

    <p>My boss likes Goldmine. He almost insists that I use it.<&#47;p>

    <p>I have only been using Outlook express for about 10 years and don't really care to learn anything else. I tried Goldmine for a while but could never get used to it. I see no advantages to Goldmine unless getting kicked out of the system, taking too long to log in, waiting for the system to get emails again and being driven crazy are advantages.<&#47;p>

    <p>I hate Goldmine and hope the company who sells it goes bankrupt.<&#47;p>

    <p>Sometimes I sit at my desk and joke at how productive I am while using Goldmine. My company prefers that we use Goldmine, probably so they can read all of our emails to make sure we stay captive. Sometimes when I actually can't wait 40 minutes to send an email, I sign onto gmail and poof my life doesn't suck anymore. Goldmine sucks so bad!<&#47;p>

    <p>You think goldmine used to be bad?  Try the very latest version - you ain't seen nothing yet.  I have had more support calls, problems and bugs in 6 months than in 15 years, mind you it doies not matter because Frontrange clearly do not want to sell it.<&#47;p>

    <p>If they did then when you call them and leave 10 voice mails saying is there a reseller in North Carolina I need to place an order, someone would call you back - but they don't.<&#47;p>

    <p>I had to buy from the UK.<&#47;p>

    <p>Guys, I couldn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t disagree more. We adopted G&#47;mine 6 years ago as a common system to manage our customer contacts. It is clunky but solid &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; just like SAP. And, just like SAP it demands users to adapt to it. When everyone wakes up to this reality &amp; gets with the programme for the common good of all users, then everyone reaps the advantage. But, if individual users are only concerned with their own individual comforts, then obviously it can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t succeed &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; but that is not G&#47;mine&acirc;&euro;&trade;s problem, it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s just a case of plain bad attitude on the part of the individual users.We run a fairly wide menu of service streams - see <a> http:&#47;&#47;torc.ie&#47;services&#47;<&#47;a>.

    <p>Goldmine is one of the worst software products ever. I told everyone that the software is junk and they did not want to believe me. So in marched consultant after consultant looking things over making recommendations. Each one eventually blows us off. So we are on 6.7 corporate and it does not work with vista or new versions of Internet Explorer but they have newer versions out. I had some guy here telling my boss that he knows other companies who are using it and it works great. So the consensus is that we have it set up wrong. So in marches a new consultant, Bob Ritter and Mary Ritter from First Direct in Hopewell Junction NY. They promise that everything will be fine if we upgrade. Well they get the money and everything is not fine. The system has a lot of problems. Oh and that guy who said he knew these other companies who were using it... well he now wants to tell the world that Goldmine, FrontRange and First Direct suck!!<&#47;p>

    <p>In response to 'One Who Knows' I'd venture to say you don't know shit!  Granted, GM has some problems, but it isn't perfect.  I also bet you haven't told the complete story here, so we may as well disregard your comments.  I have worked with GoldMine and yes, it can be frustrating at times.  But, it certainly isn't the horror story many will try to make others believe.  99% of the problems with GoldMine is related to training.  Companies buy it and won't put any time or money into learning to use it.  It's like buying a musical instrument.  If you are unwilling to invest in learning to play the right way it's going to be a frustrating activity.  In practically every case where people bitch about GoldMine crashing, throwing errors, etc. there are underlying network problems, issues with the machines themselves or just stupidity on the part  of the users.<&#47;p>

    <p>While it's true that a lot of blame falls on people using the software incorrectly, there's also a lot of problems with the software. (I haven't used it for spa number of years now so perhaps it's improved.) you say about it crashing because of network or configuration problems, but from my software development point of view, it shouldn't crash as a result of those, it should handle them gracefully. It also suffers from the UI being terrible with my overriding memory of horribleness being things like the scrollbars and the fact that clicking in a window didn't give focus to the application, you had to click the titlebar. Yes a programmer you have to go out of your way to make something that bad.<&#47;p>

    <p>It's ok though, my current job uses a different CRM package and similar accusations can be levelled against that too.<&#47;p>

    <p>Goldmine is garbage. I wonder if the guy in here blaming the users works for the company...<&#47;p>

    <p>here are just a few of the issues I have had recently:<&#47;p>

    <p>had two employees here try and save an email template which for some reason started sending out THOUSANDS of emails using that template to users<&#47;p>

    <p>the first time that happened it was an invoice for a large amount of equipment and caused a TON of angry people to call in<&#47;p>

    <p>Have you noticed that half the time you search for a last name it doesnt work and you have to search for an email instead? Really poorly designed.<&#47;p>

    <p>Using your mouse wheel to scroll down on an email &#47; window causes goldmine to switch between users - usually so fast it causes goldmine to crash<&#47;p>

    <p>I've had goldmine crap out and not work to the point where I had to reinstall it twice<&#47;p>

    <p>my boss literally has to deal with bugs and goldmine problems on a daily basis for our employees<&#47;p>

    <p>just really bad, poorly designed software. Sloppy execution, terrible UI, emails can't handle attachments well, wont display images etc<&#47;p>

    <p>just really buggy<&#47;p>

    <p>I'd venture to say, assholes really gravitate to Goldmine and like to recommend Goldmine for Dummies to the lower intellegence set.  They think emailing takes years of practice (like learning to play a musical instrument correctly).<&#47;p>

    <p>I hope Goldmine goes out of business.  Goldmine Sucks !<&#47;p>

    <p>I bought a copy of GM back in 2000, 5.0, then upgraded to 5.5.  As a former sole proprietor, I really need full functionality of GM but when I upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows 7, GM 5.5 wouldn't work correctly and I was unwilling to pay over $1000 for the business version that would.  I was able to obtain an update to GM 6.7, the last single-license version provided to non-business end-users but had to install Windows XP mode to get GM 6.7 to work, and I still get a date&#47;time error message on start-up.<&#47;p>

    <p>Many years ago when I looked into becoming really proficient with Goldmine I discovered takes a lot of time and training to properly use it.  I was and still am a salesperson, not a computer geek or whiz, and every minute I spend trying to learn how to best use a complicated and non-intuititve piece of software is time taken away from discovering sales prospects and converting prospects into customers.  Software should be a help and not a hindrance, so I tend to embrace the KISS concept.  Goldmine was not designed to be either simple or intuitive - just look at the underlying database engines, first Borland and then SQL.  I think
    I'll begin to transition to something much simpler like Outlook or even Thunderbird.  I just don't need something as complex or as buggy as GM.<&#47;p>

  content: "<p>OK.. my gripes. What the heck is GM+ View for? I've never been able
    to get it to do anything. Lot's of things (like reports) are too complex for me,
    I just want to use it to keep on top of business, not spend my life being a GM
    expert. Filters are to slow, so I use the Organization feature to group clients
    into groups. It is not very good for Projects or for organizing information. I
    use Info Select for that. I wish my scheduled activities could be prioritized
    as I have hundreds of them and I don't need bells ringing all the time for everything.
    \nGood things - \nIt doesn't crash (Ver 6.7 on Windows 7). It is easy to backup
    by coping the entire Goldmine folder and organizes contacts and their info OK.
    I like the way I can create many, many HTML email templates and easily select
    them. I like to deal with www.thetrainers.ca who I can turn to when needed as
    they are GM experts.\nI wish there were a good web based solution and maybe complainers
    should offer up solutions for us. Like what is better?<&#47;p>\n"
