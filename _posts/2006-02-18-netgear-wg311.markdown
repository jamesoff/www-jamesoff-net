<p>Bought a WG311 (v3) today while trying to sort out Roz's parents home network -- and I think I shall be taking it back tomorrow. It freezes the computer within minutes of starting; no blue screens, no errors, just flat out freezes. Having Googled around a bit it turns out I'm far from the only person having problems with this card, and other people haven't had much luck fixing it either.<br />
