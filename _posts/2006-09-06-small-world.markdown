<p>While chatting with my new boss at lunchtime the other day, she said that her favourite restaurant was in Tring, which I mentioned was near where I came from. When I said I came from Aylesbury (because most people have heard of that) she said</p>
<p>> Oh, I went to school in Aylesbury</p>
<p>"Me too!" I replied, "Which school did you go to?"</p>
<p>> [Aylesbury Grammar](http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Aylesbury_Grammar_School)</p>
<p>:fry: This might seem a little odd since AGS is an all-boys school, and Viv isn't any boy at all. However, all is explained by the fact that she started there *before* the girls split off and formed [Aylesbury High](http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Aylesbury_High_School) over the road.</p>
<p>It's a small world after all.</p>
