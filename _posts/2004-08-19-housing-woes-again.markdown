<p>Isn't this just typical? Roz and I have now been in our current place for almost 6 months to the day after being forced to move out of our old place after 7 months.</p>
<p>Today we received a phonecall from the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.leamanslettings.co.uk&#47;" target="_blank" title="Leamans">letting agency<&#47;a> telling us that our landlord wanted to sell the property we're living in :(</p>
<p>We're being offered first refusal on it (don't know the price yet), or else we get two months to find somewhere else to move into.</p>
