<p>Yesterday I cleaned out a load of comment spam... and I just had to clean out another load. 25 in under 24 hours :( This is getting out of control, and it's happening on the forums too with spam account signups.</p>
<p>I've found this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cynistar.net&#47;~apthorpe&#47;code&#47;babycart&#47;" title="Babycart - a Wordpress&#47;SA interface">thing called babycart<&#47;a> which lets you interface <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.spamassassin.org" title="Spamassassin - a free spam filter">SpamAssassin<&#47;a> with Wordpress to mark comments automatically for moderation based on their spammyness. This has the advantage of also using the URI testing in association with SpamCop.</p>
<p>I might install it later, and I might set it to refuse comments that are too spammy too.</p>
