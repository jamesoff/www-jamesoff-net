    What I want to know is why they only want to catch Policemen speeding.<br &#47;>
    <br &#47;>
    Presumably they'd use a Geek enforcement camera to get me.

<p>I was going to rant about road works, but I'm not cross anymore.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Never mind :P<br &#47;><br />

Roz's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.grooblehonk.co.uk&#47;webcams&#47;?order=roz" title="Roz's Webcam">webcam<&#47;a> seems to be working very well now, she had to apply the PCI Latency patch to stop her computer crashing; was the same problem I used to have with USB on my Abit board too. Curse you Abit *fist shakeage*<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
Ever seen the signs that say "Police Enforcement Cameras"? They're used to indicate that there are speed and&#47;or trafic signal cameras around. There's one such sign on the motorway where they're doing roadworks at the moment, and everytime I think about it I have a vision of this camera enforcing everyone to be police... "That's not a police car" *snap* "That's not a police car" *snap* etc<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I wonder why I think things like that, how strange.</p>
