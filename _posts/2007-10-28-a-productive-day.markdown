<p>What a productive day (for a Sunday):</p>
<p>1. Released [bMotion 0.1.0](http:&#47;&#47;bmotion.net) - only about 3 years after I planned on it originally. 0.1.0 is greatly improved over the previous version, and a few weeks ago I finally decided I should stop pointless tinkering with it and get a stable releasable version :)</p>
<p>2. Finished [Zelda: Phantom Hourglass](http:&#47;&#47;www.zelda.com&#47;phantomhourglass&#47;) on the DS - mainly in celebration of releasing bMotion.</p>
<p>3. Started using my Simple Monitor project at home and on my colo, and it's working well so far. The only problem was that both machines needed Python updating to support the native sqlite class. Once that was fixed, both worked fine and are now monitoring their services. Once I get some other features I'm planning on written in, I'll release it for other people to try.</p>
