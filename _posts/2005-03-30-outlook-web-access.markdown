<p>That's clever; Outlook Web Access in Exchange 2003 breaks if you try to read an email with a subject line ending "...". At least this solves the mystery of random unreadable emails in OWA. Perhaps it also applies to mails ending "." or with "." in the middle. I shall have to investigate.</p>
<p>Thanks Microsoft ... Thicrosoft.</p>
