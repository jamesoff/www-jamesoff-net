    this pereodic table is perfect for the a-level sylabas in the UK as it requires simple (not accurate numbers) and has a slight different arrangment to the american version.

    Great work, you think it'd be possible to have a key to it?

    (Wow, almost every poster who complained about getting in trouble with this couldn't spell. They also believed it despite the fact that it includes elements man, hello, and beef, among others. I wonder if there's a connection?)

    Cute. And clever. Good job finding this and piecing it together, it certainly entertained me. I love all the little additions, and even some of the fake elements seemed to blend right in. (I read kryptonite twice before I remembered that that one's made up. Silly me.) I may have to print this out and tape it in my room somewhere.

    Perhaps, to protect all the people that believed this, you could have put a warning in your post that it's fake. Because there are some people that will believe this, oddly enough. Well, too late for that now, but still a good job in making this.

    OMG yuo stuped muva-fukka!!!!!!!!!!! yuo totely ruind ma homwurk!!!!!!!

    Sigh...

    If anyone was moronic enough to think that this is a real periodic table, their homework was never really going to be that good anyway. These people had better stay clear of the program itself, Look Around You - They may start to think they are coming down with 'Cobbles' - a disease which turns you into a pile of rocks, but with the bonus of being able to fly. Or maybe they would try to create a vegetable orchestra, or a sex-change machine...

    Look Around You is meant to be a harmless spoof science series - nothing else. Apparently, some people can't see this. Thank you for introducing more people to this excellent piece of British comedy, even if it is lost on some of them.

    read what it said and just laughed. It really does fit in nicely. this reminds
    me of a site my science teacher showed me. it's all about dihydrogen monoxide,
    and how inhaling it can be fatal (inhaling water = choke, genius) for those that
    have "the litterary skils of a preschooler" (nice one) dihydroden monoxide is
    good ol' H2O (water for you real smarties out there). the site is www.dhmo.org

    People, please, obviously there are a lot of young, desperate and most notably IDIOTIC American teens and pre-teens who're googling for a periodic table and come across this.  It's not their fault they post before reading the previous comments and can't see the 'Rubarb' and 'Custard' aren't elements...

    ...this is brilliant, thank you so much!  I actually have printed off the three individual pages from the BBC and stuck them together on my wall, but it's wonderful to have them united at last.

    I have just started the (only!) group on Facebook dedicated to 'Look Around You'.  Would I be able to use your image?  Please?  With moth-apples and sulphagne on top?

    <p>I have to say this is pretty hilarious.<&#47;p>

    <p>As for the preteen yanks who are too stupid to fall for this, I have to say I'm in tears of laughter. Same goes for those who are trying to be serious about it.<&#47;p>

<p>This is the Periodic Table, as created by the BBC show "Look Around You." It's available on their site as three files, so I just stiched it together in Photoshop. Enjoy!</p>
