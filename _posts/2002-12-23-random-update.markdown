<p>So here I am hiding here in the North with Roz ^_^ mmm Roz<br &#47;><br />

Excellent. And Christmas is just round the corner, hopefully we'll be rid of it soon. Been watching some Buffy season 2 which is good; the challenge is to get though it all before I go home on the 27th.<br &#47;><br />

<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bmotion.net target="_blank">bMotion<&#47;a> continues to pick up users, slowly. Couple of random people have shown up in #bmotion on EFNet, unfortunately while they praised it, they then carried on with, "but I do have a problem with it." Still, it was nice to see this evening that they'd been talking to each other about eggdrop stuff, so perhaps bMotion will build up a bit of a community.<br &#47;><br />

Happy Christmas (feh) to all :)</p>
