<p>Comment spam on my blog is getting worse, and Roz is getting some too now :(</p>
<p>I shall sort something out for it this evening, I think. A custom solution using one of those "enter the text from this image" things should do it, because if it's non-standard (or uses randomly named form fields or something) the spammers won't be able to auto-parse it. As for them figuring this out and reading the text out of the image... I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p>
