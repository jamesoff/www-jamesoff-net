<p>Yesterday I incompetently forgot my password for my Egg account and I wanted to pay some money off my credit card. Having locked my account out by remembering the wrong password three times I phoned Egg up and reset it. When asked for the new password, I started with "Captial G, lower case D, ..."<sup>*<&#47;sup> and was interrupted to be told "Oh the system only uses lowercase letters."</p>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<p>So after all the warnings about "Make sure no one can overhear you" and "Don't tell anyone your password" they restrict your options for your password to 36 characters (wouldn't surprise me if symbols weren't allowed either). Smart.</p>
<p><sup>*<&#47;sup> Actual password characters changed to protect members of this story.</p>
