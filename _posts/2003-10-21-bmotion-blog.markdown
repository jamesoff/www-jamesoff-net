<p>I have now set up a separate <a href="http:&#47;&#47;bmotion.sf.net&#47;blog" target="_blank">blog for bMotion<&#47;a> so that the other developers can also contribute to it - the idea being that news about the project can be posted there along with throwing suggestions around for people to comment on.</p>
