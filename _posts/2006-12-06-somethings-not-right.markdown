  content: Do the directors get paid 'normal' money (i.e. as much as a normal employee)
    or 'director' money (i.e. more than you lot)? If the former I could see why this
    tradition got started, if the latter they can sod right off.

    I have no idea what the directors are paid, but they don't appear to be short of a few bob.

    Today I learned that the director's fund is up to 160 pounds, and the fund for a guy who's leaving at the end of the year is on 80. That seems just wrong and unfair :(

<p>It seems that here at work, it's traditional for every employee to chip in (like for when someone's leaving) to buy the directors a gift as a thank you for paying us thoughout the year.</p>
<p>:w-hat:</p>
<p>My "thanks" for being paid is that I've done work for these guys. If they want a gift in return for paying me, then they'll have to choose between that and me actually doing work. I don't mind no doing anything all year, getting paid for it and then buying them a present at the end of the year.</p>
<p>No thanks, I don't think I'll be contributing to that.</p>
