<p>So I took the plunge and installed FreeBSD 5.1 on my desktop machine on a spare 4Gb drive to see if it liked my hardware and if I liked what I could do with it on the desktop.</p>
<p>It's been about an hour since I first booted (after install) and it's working fine and I'm quite impressed with KDE 3.1.2 (especially compared to where I last saw KDE, which was 3.0 on Debian at 800x600).</p>
<p>Let's see where it goes from here, it'd be cool if I only had to reboot to XP for things like games, but we'll see. Next I shall recompile the kernel to add support for my SB Live, unless I work out if I can use modules to do that somehow...</p>
