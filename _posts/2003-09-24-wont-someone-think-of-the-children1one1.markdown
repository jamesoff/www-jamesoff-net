    Yeah, What the newspapers are keeping quiet on is that MSN have been considering this move on cost grounds for a long, long time now, the chat service doesn't support itself any more and has little marketing value.  Plus it encroaches a little on messenger.

    This was just a damn good way to get some publicity.

<blockquote><p>Microsoft's internet service MSN is to drastically cut back its chatroom services because of concerns about child safety.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>MSN's chatrooms are not the only chat service on the Internet.</p>
<p>EFNet reports "There are 5800 users and 109213 invisible on 56 servers," and there are several other networks about that size, with a large number of smaller networks too. Other messenger services (Y! etc) are still available and people will just switch to these alternative services, some of which are unpolicable in the same way MSN is.</p>
<p>The shutdown&#47;restriction of MSN will make no difference to the people they are trying to remove, and will only cause inconvenience to the people they are trying to protect.</p>
<p>The only solution to the problem is for parents to be careful about what their children are doing on the Internet.</p>
