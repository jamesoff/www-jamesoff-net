    I had basically the same thing happen to me when I added a 4-disk raid array, except that I had my data drive wibble *and* one of the ones in the new array  :s

    Thankfully it's all been happy (*touches wood*) since I RMA'd that one and moved the old data drive to a machine which is less critical.  It also pretends to be fine now, no matter how much I thrash&#47;test&#47;benchmark it...

    Backup on the other hand... how are you going to back that lot up?  I keep meaning to do something about backup of my ~840Gb raid set, but what can I do other than huge tape, DVD-R (ugh) or more drives?

    The plan is to not.

    Nothing critical will go on there, and if it does die, I'll be sad but I won't have lot anything important.

    The system (in fact, all my systems) get backed up onto a different set of disks running as a GEOM mirror.

    If I could afford a backup solution that would fit that lot then I would, but I can't, so I'll just have to hope it doesn't go too wrong ;)

<p>Last week I finally got my ~terabyte storage finished!</p>
<p>    Filesystem     Size    Used   Avail Capacity  Mounted on<br />
    &#47;dev&#47;ar0s1d    677G     99G    571G    15%    &#47;raid5</p>
<p>It's less than 1024GB thanks to drive manufacturers using dodgy calculations, and also it's RAID5, so I lose a disk's worth of space (250GB). Seem to be doing a reasonable job of filling it up though ;)</p>
<p>This morning, though, I was greeted with the this email:</p>
<p>>    This email was generated by the smartd daemon running on:<br />
><br />
>    host name: yomi.jamesoff.net<br />

>    The following warning&#47;error was logged by the smartd daemon:<br />
><br />
>    Device: &#47;dev&#47;ad0, Self-Test Log error count increased from 0 to 1        `</p>
<p>Arrgh :argh:</p>
<p>At least that's the system drive rather than one of the new ones, but now I'm going to have to buy a new system drive and prepare to migrate over to it. At least thanks to having plenty of space, I have full `dump(1)`s of the drive so even if it does die before I replace it I can recover fairly easily.</p>
