<p>2251.05 [@ JamesOff] Can I write my own QuoteEngine script before midnight?<br &#47;><br />
...<br &#47;><br />
2352.20 [@ JamesOff] I think we're done<br &#47;><br />
2352.24 [@ JamesOff] well<br &#47;><br />
2352.29 [@ JamesOff] close enough for me to go to bed, anyway :)<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
VICTORY FOR JAMES(*$&pound;(*&pound;$<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The new quotes script currently only supports adding quotes, but it does it all in TCL (using mySQL extensions) rather than some ugly hack with perl. I shall h4x0r it some more over the next week or so.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
The online #exeter quotes page remains <a href="http:&#47;&#47;icq.ex.ac.uk&#47;~notopic&#47;quotes">http:&#47;&#47;icq.ex.ac.uk&#47;~notopic&#47;quotes<&#47;a>. The old quotes are currently at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;icq.ex.ac.uk&#47;~notopic&#47;quotes&#47;old.php">http:&#47;&#47;icq.ex.ac.uk&#47;~notopic&#47;quotes&#47;old.php<&#47;a>, and I'll migrate them into the new database very soon.<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
I've added the TopicEngine RSS feed above (you probably noticed that).<br &#47;><br />
<br &#47;><br />
MallMonkeys is quite drastically down now, their host is serving a placeholder page for www.mallmonkeys.com :(</p>
