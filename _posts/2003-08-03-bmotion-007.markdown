    &#47;me slaps JamesOff around a bit with a new release

<p>Finally I have released bMotion 0.0.7! It's been about four months since the last version.</p>
<p>Recently bMotion seems to have become more popular, with about 15 people in #bmotion on EFNet now, and some email traffic for me (both on and off the bMotion lists). One nice man has started work on an Italian translation, which I will hopefully include in 0.0.8.</p>
<p>Greg Sweetman has offered to join the development team, but unfortunately SourceForge.net is having problems adding him to the project properly and he can't get access to CVS :( In the meantime he's going to send me his work and I'll commit it.</p>
<p>Here's the changelog for 0.0.7, enjoy!</p>
