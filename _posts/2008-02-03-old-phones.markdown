    <p>I really love the second Nokia, it's really cool, a friend of mine had it and I really like it. Yeah, Tesco do take them for &Acirc;&pound;10 each which you probably should have done, but oh well. It's a bit late now :D<&#47;p>

    <p>I have also kept my first Sony Ericsson mobile phone, which is identical to the one pictured on your site. I have the box, charger and manuel. along with a few other accesories. I think that one day in the future it might be a collectors item and therefore i won't be throwing mine away!<&#47;p>

    <p>iv bought a ericsson sh888 in summer, july  of the year 1999, back then it was your everyday cellphone even i didnt think how much a brick it was no one did but i didnt dare put it in my pants pocket cus your right the battery would slid right off. i would get a call and pull it out of my pants poket and the battery would slid off and make me so mad it was a ok phone the menu was slow the display sucked so in july of the year 2001 after my two year contract with cellular one i switched to vrizon and got one of the very first camra filp cellphones $800 the sucker cost me i think it was a sanyo i forgot the model i felt so importand with that phone i even learnd to text with it though very few people texted in the year of 2001 my friends taught me how and we texted back and forth. the only bad thing about texting in 2001 was it was slow it took along time for the cellphone to send the text message to whoever i texted and it wasnt just my cellphone eather my friends said the samthing when thay sent text to me or any one else. i also had lots of dropped calls with my sanyo camra flip phone in 2001 probubly cuz it was so new and having so many features for how small and compact it was. plus it was 2001 the beging of new technology after all. but never with my ericsson sh888 thats one thing i loved about that phone i could be in the outskritts of towm on a long distence call and it wouldnt drop the call that was 1999 today its 2013 we all have smartphones with touch screen displays you go to the outskritts of town you might a as well say your goodbys cus you get cutt off.<&#47;p>

<p>While sorting out boxes of stuff hidden away in a cupboard (so I'd have less pointless stuff to carry around when we move house), I came across some of my old mobile phones.</p>
<p>Exactly why I kept them I'm not sure, but I tend to find it difficult to throw old hardware away in general. I have a whole drawer of old ISA cards that I need to sort out later.</p>

<p>Ericsson SH888<br />

<p>My first mobile phone, which I got in late 1999&#47;early 2000 I think. It's definitely a 'brick' phone, being shaped exactly like one only slightly bigger and less useful for contacting your friends. It has a three-line block character display so the most graphical part of the menus was an arrow character indicating where you could scroll. I remember two things in particular about this phone: it was very very slow and the way the battery clipped on the back meant pulling it out of your pocket could cut the power (before it had saved a record of who the incoming call was from).</p>
<p>Nokia 7110<br />

<p>This was my second phone which I got in mid-2000. It's a slide phone, a bit like the one used by Neo in The Matrix. It has a little silver button on the back which where your finger rests which makes the slide jump open. They were renowned for breaking, particularly if you let your friends play with them. The other gimmick of this phone was the roller control, which worked like a scroll wheel on a mouse. It was ok, although I think it was easy to accidentally scroll and select the item either side of what you actually wanted when you tried to click. There were a couple of scrollwheel-based games on it but nothing amazing. It was also a bit slow, but was my first phone with predictive text.</p>
<p>Nokia 6820<br />

<p>Skip forward a couple of handsets (a Nokia 6230 which was awesome and a Sony Z7 which was shit) and we arrive at the Nokia 6820. I could never actually remember this phone's model number and even now found it so unmemorable that I had to look under the battery three times. It was a pretty neat phone though, which swung open (and rotated 90 degrees) to give a split QWERTY keyboard for writing texts. It was marketed as a business phone but the mobile browser on it was so rubbish I think they'd have been better sticking to branding it a phone for people who send a lot of SMSes. The QWERTY keyboard worked really well but the phone was let down by a display that was slow to update (very [Dual scan](http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Dual_Scan)) and was set about half a centimeter back from the plastic case which was a bit weird.</p>
<p>All these phones have finally been consigned to the bin having at last served the purpose I probably kept them for - nostalgia.</p>
