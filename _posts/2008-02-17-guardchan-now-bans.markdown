<p>After a user request on IRC, my [guardchan](&#47;site&#47;code&#47;eggdrop-scripts&#47;guardchan) script can now actually ban as well as kicking when it detects an unauthorised user joining the channel.</p>
<p>(The page for the script incorrectly said that it kickbanned already, but that was an error due to me writing the script about a thousand years ago.)</p>
<p>Hope it's of some use :)</p>
